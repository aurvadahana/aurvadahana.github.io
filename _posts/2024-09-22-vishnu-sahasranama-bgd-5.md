### 37. स्वयम्भूः / Svayambhūḥ - He who Manifests Himself [[ot]](#ot37)

**ॐ स्वयम्भुवे नमः**

Whence is all this greatness [[f1]](#ff1)? Because He is **स्वयम्भूः** - maniferting Himself.

The affix '**क्विप्**' comes after '**भू**' when the word so formed denotes a name or surety [[37.1]](#f371), [[f2]](#ff2). For the purpose of His sport (**लीला**) He, out of His own free will, with His Prakṛti (or essential nature) which is exclusively His and which is of the quality of pure Sattva, assumes and permeates the forms similar to those of gods and men. Unlike in the case of the four-faced Brahma and others, who are not independent, His **birth is not controlled** by any other god or **by Karma**.

"For the sake of His devotees, supreme Brahman manifests itself (**स्वयम्भूः**)." [[37.2]](#f372)

"I get into my own Prakṛti (composed of Śuddhasattva) and am born by my own will" [[37.3]](#f373)

Though the two Prakṛtis - the one composed of the three qualities (Sattva, Rajas, and Tamas); and the other the sentient (Jīvātmā) - belong to Him, still this Prakṛti (i.e., the Śuddhasattva is specifically referred to as "My own Prakṛti" (**प्रकृतिं स्वाम्**) because it belongs exclusively to Him and is the world of enjoyment.

In the Harivaṃśa, in the episode of bringing back the sons of the Vaidika Brāhmaṇa from Śrī Vaikuṇṭha, He refers to the two Prakṛtis (Cetana and Acetana) which are the instruments for His sport, and continues -

<div id="ff3r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

"You have seen the splendour of Brahman which is celestial and wonderful. O Best of Bharatas! I am that. And that is my splendour and it is eternal. Bharata! That Prakṛti of mine is superior and it is of two kinds - gross and subtle (visible and invisible - **व्यक्ताव्यक्त** [[f3]](#ff3)); O the greatest amongst Bharatas! Once the souls enter into it, they become Muktas (i.e. free from the cycle of birth and death)." [[37.4]](#f374)

<div id="ff4r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

It is clearly mentioned in Śrī Viṣṇu Tattva after mentioning the five Śaktis (Five Śaktis are the five forms of Bhagavan - Para, Vyūha, etc. [[f4]](#ff4)) -

"The manifestations of the Supreme Being as Matsya, Kūrma, and Varāha are composed of this effulgent substance (known as Śuddhasattva) and not of any other substance which is not like it and so counter to it, O Best of Dvijas!" [[37.5]](#f375)

Viṣṇu Purāṇa refers to the five forms of Bhagavan, as "All these five Śaktis" [[37.6]](#f376) by which it is indicated that they are all of them unique and superior because of the nature of their manifestation, purpose, cause, source, time, number and other things.

In Śrī Rāmāyaṇa it is said:—

"The Supreme Lord of all worlds Himself (brought about the end of the Rākṣasas) with a desire to do good to the world." [[37.7]](#f377)

"Being requested by the gods who wanted the end of the proud Rāvaṇa, Viṣṇu, the eternal Lord, took birth in this world of mortals." [[37.8]](#f378)

"He manifested by Himself and shone." [[37.9]](#f379)

<div id="tr38" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

### 38. शम्भुः / Śambhuḥ - The Source of Happiness (by the beauty of His appearance) [[ot]](#ot38)

**ॐ शम्भवे नमः**

He is 'Śambhu' because He causes '**शं**' (Happiness) [[f5]](#ff5) to all by manifesting thus His beauty, availability and other qualities.

<div id="ff6r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

In the section dealing with '**डु**' suffix, that suffix is added to words like '**मितद्रु**' according to a grammatical rule [[38.1]](#f381), [[f6]](#ff6).

"He visualises all things directly; He is the cause of Bliss for all beings." [[38.2]](#f382)

This has been explained by the following slokas in the Rāmāyaṇa —

"Śrī Rāma attracts the eyes and the hearts of men by His beauty, generosity and similar qualities" [[38.3]](#f383)

"Rāma who has a face lovelier than the moon, and who has an extremely pleasing appearance." [[38.4]](#f384)

<div id="tr39" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

### 39. आदित्यः / Ādityaḥ - The Puruṣa in the Sun [[ot]](#ot39)

**ॐ आदित्याय नमः**

Next the Puruṣa in the Sun is given as an example for the manifestation or incarnation (at His Will, as in the previous names). Āditya (Sun) is the abiding place for Him.

<div id="ff7r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

The affix '**ण्य**' comes after the proper names Diti, Aditi and Āditya [[39.1]](#f391), [[f7]](#ff7).

It has been established thus in the Brahmasūtra (in Antaḥstatthvādhikaraṇa):

"He who is seen in the interior of the Sun is the supreme Brahman, because the qualities that are mentioned in that context pertain only to Brahman." [[39.2]](#f392)

"The lovely resplendent Puruṣa who is seen in the interior of the Sun." [[39.3]](#f393)

"He, is only the same (Deity) who is seen in the heart of a human being and who is seen In the Sun" [[39.4]](#f394)

"He must always be meditated upon who is in the middle of the orb of the Sun”. [[39.5]](#f395)

This passage is quoted and the Upaniṣad says with reference to Him who is in the interior of the Sun that "His two eyes are like the lotus flower that has been blossomed by the Sun." [[39.6]](#f396)

<div id="tr40" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

### 40. पुष्कराक्षः / Puṣkarākṣaḥ - The Lotus-Eyed [[ot]](#ot40)

**ॐ पुष्कराक्षाय नमः**

(561) The name **Puṣkarākṣaḥ** associates Bhagavān with the possession of lotus eyes which is a specific indication that He is the Sole Ruler of the entire universe. This is a compound word ending with the '**अच्**' suffix according to a grammatical rule that the word '**अक्षि**' will take the '**अच्**'suffix when it does not mean "the eye". [[40.1]](#f401), [[f8]](#ff8)

<div id="tr41" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

### 41. महास्वनः / Mahāsvanaḥ - He of Venerable Sound [[ot]](#ot41)

**ॐ महास्वनाय नमः**

This name indicates another distinctive mark of His. '**महान्**' means venerable and '**स्वन:**' means sound, i.e. possessed of venerable sound. The final vowel '**अ**' of the word '**महत्**' is replaced by long '**आ**' in a compound where both the words are in the same case (i.e. in apposition) [[41.1]](#f411), [[f9]](#ff9).

"His name is **उत्** (He who is above foibles)" [[39.6]](#f396)

The name and form of this (Supreme Being) have as their basis, sound (i.e, the Vedas).

"He is indeed the three Vedas. He is the charming Puruṣa shining in the interior of the Sun" [[41.2]](#f412). Thus His form is the three Vedas themselves; or He is the Supreme object of worship since He is signified by the sāvitrī (i.e. Gāyitrī).

Therefore it is mentioned in the Mokṣadharma about Bhagavān as follows:

"I am the Eternal Puruṣa who is in the Solar Orb and who is closely associated with Vidyā" [[41.3]](#f413).

<div id="tr42" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

### 42. अनादिनिधनः / Anādinidhanaḥ - One Who is without Beginning or End [[ot]](#ot42)

**ॐ अनादिनिधनाय नमः**

#### Part 1 - His Eternal Body (and not just Eternal Nature)

With such a celestial name and form, He is without beginning or end. Since His youthfulness is eternal, He is possessed of a body which is eternal, and which is devoid of the foibles of birth, old age and the like. This should not be interpreted as signifying the eternity of His essential nature, because that is the same in the case of the four-faced Brahmā and others also.

"He has a resplendent form and has the power of making all that he wills come out true." [[42.1]](#f421)

“He is the enchanting Puruṣa." [[39.3]](#f393)

“Out of the sparkling Puruṣa (sprang all objects)." [[12.2]](#f422)

“He is of the radiance of the Sun and is beyond the region of Tamas (i.e. Prakṛti, mortal world)." [[42.3]](#f423)

“He has all the worlds which are His creation, and endowed with all fragrance and with all tastes”. [[42.1]](#f421)

“The Supreme Puruṣa is to be meditated upon as having the lustre of gold and reached by a knowledge which is unaffected by external forces and which can be compared to the undisturbed dream (of a man)." [[42.4]](#f424)

“Puruṣa who is lotus-eyed." [[42.5]](#f425)

There are thousands of Śrutis and Smṛtis like those quoted above which establish that the Lord has a body which He assumes out of His own free will, which is like a blue cloud in the midst of sparkling rows of lightnings, which is spotless, blue and shining, and which is endowed with lovable qualities like Supreme loveliness, beauty and youthfulness.

It is further stated with reference to this form of Paramātmā as follows:

“He is possessed of a body which is always in the same state and immutable." [[42.6]](#f426)

“He has the mole named Śrīvatsa on His chest and is endowed with ever-lasting beauty." [[42.7]](#f427)

Sage Parāśara says - "This Bhagavān is Time itself and keeps all things under His control."

"There is no Tattva (Reality) superior to Viṣṇu and his body is beyond the sway of time."

By these and other such clear declarations, the fact is beyond dispute that the body of the Lord is eternal. The reasons for the same are - It pertains to Bhagavān who is always the cause; it is also one of the attributes like knowledge etc., which define His essential nature (Svarūpa); it exists beyond the Prakṛti which is called Tamas; it is beyond the region of mutations like birth and the like: it is specifically stated that it is immutable and is beyond the sway of time; and also by the Tatkratu maxim (i.e. the theory that the result is in the same proportion as the means) —

The devotee attains the blissful experience of the body of Bhagavān which is similar to the one on which he meditates here.

#### Part 2

Such is the strength of the scriptures (Āgamas) and reasons about the nature of the form of the Supreme Being. Contrary to this, no theory based on inferences can be put forward which will try to set up a body which is imaginary or new (and not eternal). Therefore, texts, which seem to declare Paramātmā as formless, must be taken to mean that He has no body **which is like that of the mortals or which is despicable**. In fact Śāstrīya texts like the following give the same interpretation -

"The body of Paramātmā is not made up of the combination of elements like earth, water etc."

"His form is not composed of earthly elements like fat, flesh and bone."

In the wake of Bādarāyaṇa (the author of the Brahmasūtras), the commentators (Vākyakāra and Bhāṣyakāra) also have propounded that the form of the Supreme Brahman in the interior of the Sun is eternal.

"His body is beyond the range of the sense-organs, for it is stated that it can be cognised only by the eye of the mind"

"Truly the body of the creator of the universes is eternal"

#### Part 3

"Even the Incarnations of the Lord have no beginning or end unlike the bodies of the worldly beings. But it is only a case of exit from and entry into the Paramapada like an actor coming on the stage from behind the curtain and then disappearing by going away.

This my unique body is endowed with four arms and is in that celestial Abode. O gods! Worship the inscrutable body of mine which has come to the human world. I live in it for ever."

“O Supreme God! The world has been freed from all distress. Come to the Heavens which is for all times protected and which is devoid of all defects and sins."

"He entered the world of Lustre of Viṣṇu with His own body and with His followers."

Such, indeed, is the secret guarded by the sages.

<div id="tr43" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

### 43. धाता / Dhātā - The Creator [[ot]](#ot43)

**ॐ धात्रे नमः**

This name signifies the glory of Bhagavan which is superior to that of Brahmā and others, because of His being the cause of all things, The word ends with the affix '**तृन्**'. 'Bhartā' (<a target="_blank" href="https://aurvadahana.github.io/posts/vishnu-sahasranama-bgd-4/#tr33">33</a>) and other words also are like this. The name Dhātā signifies that Bhagavān, in the form of Aniruddha, places Brahmā the foetus who is the aggregate of sentient beings in Prakṛti which is the cause of all and which is the aggregate of non-sentient objects.

"The great Brahman (i.e., Prakṛti) is my womb and I impregnate it." In the Maulasaṃhitā it is stated -

"Dhātā places in the Kṣetra (i.e. Prakṛti) the foetus (i.e., Jīva) which is the seed for actions."

First He created the waters; and in them (in the aggregate state of Prakṛti), He put in His vigour (the sentient aggregate)".

<div id="tr44" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

### 44. विधाता / Vidhātā - The Producer [[ot]](#ot44)

**ॐ विधात्रे नमः**

Bhagavān is called Vidhātā, because He develops the foetus and makes it appear.

"He who creates Brahmā at first."

"Then once again Nārāyaṇa" - begins the Vedic text (and says) "There the four-faced Brahmā was born."

"Bhagavān saw Brahmā as he was being born."

“From Him, Virāṭ (i.e. Brahmā) was born."

"Therein was born Brahmā himself who is known as the grand sire of the universe."

From these and other texts the fact mentioned above (can be known as being correct)

<div id="tr45" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

### 45. धातुरुत्तमः / Dhāturuttamaḥ - Far Superior to Brahmā [[ot]](#ot45)

**ॐ धातुरुत्तमाय नमः**

Therefore Bhagavān is far superior to the creator. From this it goes without saying that He is superior to (Dakṣa and other) Prajāpatis who are created by that Brahmā, on the analogy of the maxim of Daṇḍa and Apūpa

Daṇḍāpūpa-Nyāya - The maxim of the stick and the cakes. When a stick (to drive away the rats) and the cakes have been kept together, and one says that ‘the stick has been eaten away by the rats', we are naturally led to expect that the cakes also would have been eaten away by those rats, as a matter, of course, since both of them have been kept together. So when one thing is closely connected with another in some way and we say something of the one, it naturally follows that what we assert about the one can, as a matter of course, be asserted of the other also. If it is stated that Viṣṇu is greater than Brahmā, who creates the Prajāpatis, it naturally follows that He is greater than those Prajāpatis also (who were created by Brahmā).

"Nārāyaṇa is the Supreme Tattva (Reality)"

The question was put - “Who is the Highest Deity amongst all these gods?" And the reply was - "Nārāyaṇa is the Supreme God and from him was born the four-faced Brahmā."

The same is clear from the dialogue between Brahmā and Rudra and from the Yajña-Agra-haraṇa (Chapter on the order of precedence in honouring the gods and the priests in a sacrifice).

## Further notes

<div id="ff1" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

**[[f1]](#tr37)** As mentioned in **प्रभुरीश्वरः** in the previous verse.

<div id="ff2" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

**[[f2]](#tr37)** The **क्विप्** suffix changes a word from verb to a noun. The suffix itself undergoes **लोप**/elision, where the suffix itself disappears, leaving no visible marker in the final word. As per this sūtra in Aṣṭādhyāyī, the root भू retains its form but now functions as a noun, typically indicating an agent or entity. TLDR, the **क्विप्** suffix transforms the verbal root **भू** ("to be") into a nominal form that conveys the sense of an agent or entity defined by its role.

<div id="ff3" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

**[[f3]](#ff3r)** Also refer <a target="_blank" href="https://aurvadahana.github.io/posts/vishnu-sahasranama-bgd-2/#:~:text=which%20is%20both%20Vyakta%20and%20Avyakta">here</a>

<div id="ff4" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

**[[f4]](#ff4r)** Read <a target="_blank" href="https://aurvadahana.github.io/posts/vishnu-sahasranama-bgd-1/#ff1">here</a>

<div id="ff5" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

**[[f5]](#tr38)** **शं सुखं भावयति इति शम्भुः**

<div id="ff6" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

**[[f6]](#ff6r)** The **डु** suffix is similar to the **क्विप्** suffix after the verb **भू**. It also undergoes **लोप**/elision as per the Aṣṭādhyāyī <a target="_blank" href="https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/suutra/3.2/3.2.180/">3.2.180</a>. Its usage is found in other names like <a target="_blank" href="https://aurvadahana.github.io/posts/vishnu-sahasranama-bgd-1/#tr4">Bhūta-bhavya-bhavatprabhuḥ</a> (4), <a target="_blank" href="https://aurvadahana.github.io/posts/vishnu-sahasranama-bgd-4/#tr35">Prabhuḥ</a> (35).

<div id="ff7" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

**[[f7]](#ff7r)** The **ण्य** suffix has a meaning of "pertaining to", and as per Aṣṭādhyāyī <a target="_blank" href="https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/suutra/4.1/4.1.85/">4.1.85</a>, it applies to words **दिति**, **अदिति**, **आदित्य** and words that end with **पति** (like **प्रजापति**). Does not undergo **लोप**. It is similar to the **अपत्यं पुमान्** on these words.

<div id="ff8" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

**[[f8]](#tr40)** As per this sūtra - **यत्र समस्तपदस्य उत्तरपदरूपेण 'अक्षि' इति शब्दः विद्यते, तत्र 'अच्' इति समासान्तप्रत्ययः भवति । परन्तु यदि समस्तपदेन नेत्रस्य निर्देशः क्रियते, तर्हि अयमच्-प्रत्ययः न भवति ।** - "Whenever the compund word's (**समस्तपद**) final component (**उत्तरपद**) is the word **अक्षि**, the suffix **अच्** is applied as a **समासान्तप्रत्ययः** (suffix used at the end of a compound). However, if the compound word refers specifically to the eye, then this **अच्** suffix is not applied." i.e., **पुष्करम् इदमक्षि इव** -> **पुष्कर + अक्षि + अच्** -> **पुष्कराक्ष**, while **ब्राह्मणस्य अक्षि** -> **ब्राह्मणाक्षि**. Though counter-intuitive (since **पुष्कराक्ष** seems to refers to 'the eye'), it is not referring to the literal eye, but it is referring to a "person" who has eyes like the lotus. Similarly, **लवणाक्ष**.

Other examples: **पुष्कराक्षि** (if it exists) could refer to a literal lotus-eye, and **ब्राह्मणाक्ष** could refer to a "Brāhmaṇa-like eye", whatever that means. Much clarity on this could be obtained from <a target="_blank" href="https://ashtadhyayi.github.io/suutra/5.4/5.4.76/">here</a>.

<div id="ff9" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">;</div>

**[[f9]](#tr41)** As in **महत: देव:** = **महादेवः**, **महत: ब्राह्मण:** = **महाब्राह्मण:**, etc. which are in adposition. Apposition, as defined in Vyākaraṇa, is a grammatical construction where one word is placed next to another to explain or identify it. But, **महत: पुत्र:** = **महत्पुत्रः** "the son of a great man" the two words are not in adposition.
