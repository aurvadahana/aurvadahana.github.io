A few points on śaraṇāgatī: from a Viśiṣṭādvaita POV

## Keywords

prāpti (śaraṇāgati) - attainment
<br />
prāptaḥ (śaraṇāgata) - attainer
<br />
prāpyam (śaraṇya) - destination
<br />
prāpakam - the way
<br />
<br />
siddha - Something you do not create; which always exists
<br />
sādhya - Something you put effort in to make it happen
<br />
sādhana - the means
<br />
sādhaka - one who performs

## Śaraṇāgati

In śaraṇāgati, pravṛtti (action, exertion) is not done by the sādhaka but by bhagavān himself. In a sādhyopāsana like bhaktiyoga, sādhaka performs pravṛtti. Śaraṇāgati is siddhopāsana; sādhaka is nivṛtta ("inactive"). But since some form of pravṛtti should be present for mokṣa, it is performed by Bhagavān himself.

The nivṛtti is NOT of action, but only of the means. Kaiṅkaryam, Tarpaṇam, Śrāddham, Sandhyāvandanam, Nāmasaṅkīrtanam etc should all be continued, but there are not done as *the means* of mokṣa but merely as service to the lord.

 <!--- have to write more here--->
 
The above things are not wanted by bhagavān himself, he has nothing lacking. It is the intent of the sādhaka to perform them which matters. Mother doesn't require help while cooking but yet she is very happy when the child offers help

The initial point of Śaranāgati is failure and the request of the jīvas to Bhagavān to take over the responsibility of mokṣa. Hence, the right candidate is always the one who has concern for mokṣa. After śaraṇāgati, his concern becomes the concerns of bhagavān. Śoka is the "**adhikāra**", while śokanivṛtti is the phalam


> ananya sādhye svābīṣṭe mahāvɪsvāsapūrvakam
>
> tadeka upāyakā yañcā prapatti śaraṇāgatiḥ


When the jīva is sure, his destination can't be reached by any others means, he requests for complete transfer of responsibility, with **absolutely no doubts**. 

Here it is important which mārga one adopts while performing śaraṇāgati. If one doesn't realise he has no other means and still believes that pravṛttimārga is the means, then one cannot be a nivṛtta and perform no karma. In śaraṇāgati, means is bhagavān himself, while in pravṛttimārga it is karma which is the means

## Prerequisites for Śaraṇāgati

For the jīva -

**1** - ākiñcanyam (kiñcit - little, akiñcana - one who knows not even a little)

Hence the sādhaka has to ACCEPT that one is handicapped, else this is not the mārga to be chosen. It will be unfair otherwise, like the government giving freebies to the unworthy

**2** - ananyagatitvam - There is no other means to the jīva other than bhagavān himself

While śaraṇāgati can be performed by anyone at any place at any time, it cannot be performed TO anyone. For an entity to be śaraṇya, it too has 2 of requirements - paratvam (absolute supremacy) and saulabhyam (easy accessibility). As per śruti-smṛtis, it can only be Nārāyaṇa - **tvameva me upāya bhūte bhavaḥ**.

The bhāva of the sādhaka is that - you have no other gati, only this mārga. Otherwise one has to choose the bhaktimārgam

## Śaraṇāgati in Rāmāyaṇa

Śaraṇāgati can happen for various reasons (like Uttarā, Draupadī, Yuddhiṣṭhira for rājya etc) but the ideal way is how Vibhīṣaṇa did so - for kaiṅkaryam. Expect nothing in return. Absolute absence of ahaṅkāra.

A few cases of Śaraṇāgatis in Rāmāyaṇa:

### 1. Devatā śaraṇāgati to Viṣṇu - to plead for his help, regarding Rāvaṇa

Here, all the four conditions for Śaraṇāgati matched.

The devatās were all helpless, and knew there is no other way out of this than to approach Nārāyaṇa (and not any other entity)

Also, the one they approached to has the qualities of paratva and saulabhya as His very own nature

### 2. Daśaratha to Paraśurāma

Daśaratha says - **bālānām mama putrāṇām..** while trying to save his sons from the Aurva Bhārgava's wrath.

He says, "there were mere children, and that they were *my* sons". And since he considers so, as per Daśaratha, he had to resort to Kṣatriyadharma and take up his bow and arrow to fight.

Daśaratha here had resorted to other gatis than Bhagavān himself. So this Śaraṇāgati failed.

Furthermore as per Viśiṣṭādvaita, Paraśurāma is an aṃśāvatāra, and not Bhagavān himself. He neither had paratva, and nor the approachability (saulabhya), and śaraṇāgati to a wrong entity too is not a successful śaraṇāgati 

### 3. Lakṣmaṇa to Rāma - accompany for vanavāsa

The very first verse in that chapter, Vālmīki writes:

> **सीतामुवाचातियशां राघवं च महाव्रतम् \|\| (2.31.1)**
>
> Lakṣmaṇa said, to the illustrious (atiyaśa) Sītā and Rāghava who is mahāvrata

Three things to note here. First, Vālmīki mentions Sītā here first, as Lakṣmaṇa salutes her first. Because śaraṇāgati always goes through Mahālakṣmī and not directly to Nārāyaṇa. Without her there is no śaraṇāgatī
<br />
**Second**, Sītā is referred here as atiyaśa or illustrious/famous. Famous for what? For her Ānukūlyasaṅkalpa, or her resolve to favour her Bhaktas towards Bhagavān
<br />
And finally, Bhagavān is mentioned both as Rāghava and Mahāvrata. Rāghava for his saulabhya, easy of accessibility; for even the supreme took birth in a human (raghu-)kula so that his devotees could benefit from His darśana. And Mahāvrata, of great resolve, because he never rejects anyone who approached him for Śaraṇāgati through Sītā (as he famously <a target="_blank" href="https://www.valmiki.iitk.ac.in/content?language=dv&field_kanda_tid=6&field_sarga_value=18&field_sloka_value=3&scgr=1&choose=1">says</a>, **न त्यजेयं कथञ्चन**)


And another thing about Lakṣmaṇa's śaraṇāgatī was, his only desire was to accompany Rāma for kaiṅkaryam, and not mokṣa.

> **न देवलोकाक्रमणं नामरत्वमहं वृणे \|**
>
> **ऐश्वर्यं वापि लोकानां कामये न त्वया विना \|\| (2.31.5)**
>
> Without you, I desire neither the dominion of the devalokas, nor amaratva (immortality), nor sovereignity over all the worlds

It is worth to digress and quote the beautiful Govindarāja ṭīkā here:

> **... देवलोकाक्रमणम् "देवानां पूरयोध्या" इत्युक्तपरमपदप्राप्तिं त्वया विना न वृणे \| त्वत्कैङ्कर्य्यविनाकृतं मोक्षमपि न वाञ्छामीत्यर्थ: \| अमरत्वम् "जरामरणमोक्षाय" इत्युक्तं कैवल्याख्यं मोक्षमपि न वृणे \| लोकानामैश्वर्यं त्रिलोकाधिपतित्वम्, ब्रह्मत्वमिति यावत् \| मोक्षमप्यकामयमानोऽहं कथं कैवल्यादिकं कामयेयेति भाव: \|**

There are 3 things Lakṣmaṇa particularly refers to here.
<br />
**1** - "devaloka-ākramaṇa": he means the very paramapada and Ayodhyā itself. This means, he does not desire even paramapada - or mokṣa - without serving him.
<br />
**2** - "amaratva"; and by amaratva kaivalya is meant. As per Viśiṣṭādvaita, <a target="_blank" href="https://ramanuja.org/sri/BhaktiListArchives/Article?p=mar2001%2F0179.html#:~:text=Kaivalya%20is%20said%20to%20be%20a%20transient%20state%20of%20aloofness%20where%20the%0AjIva%20realizes%20its%20position%20with%20respect%20to%20God">kaivalya</a> is a lower form of Mokṣa where the Jīvātma realises his relation with Bhagavān and attains immortality but not paramapada, a limited enjoyment of Bhagavān.
<br />
**3** - "lokānāmaiśvarya"; He implies trilokadhipatitva and brahmatva itself

To make it coherent, what Lakṣmaṇa means to say is, why would I need any of that when I don't even want Mokṣa without serving you?

The chapter is quite a beautiful one, and ends with Lakṣmaṇa reciting:
>**भवांस्तु सह वैदेह्या गिरिसानुषु रंस्यते \|**
>
>**अहं सर्वं करिष्यामि जाग्रत: स्वपतश्च ते \|\| (2.31.25)**
>
> When you, along with Vaidehī, go for delights in the mountain slopes; whether you are awake or asleep, अहं सर्वं करिष्यामि - I shall do everything

### 4. Bharata to Rāma - failed (or we could say, a delayed success) despite all conditions matching.

Here, Bharata's purpose for surrendering to Bhagavān is to get Rāma back to Ayodhyā, which succeeded only after 14 years. **Rāma hence returned to Ayodhyā only because of Bharata's śaraṇāgati request**, but he returned later since he had to complete the devatā śaraṇāgati as well

When a sādhaka performs śaraṇāgati, he or she may have to wait till when bhagavān wishes - **śaraṇya hṛdaya anusārī**. The jīva must have the quality of having no expectations

### 5. Vibhīṣaṇa to Rāma

When Vibhīṣaṇa approahces Rāma's camp, he asks Sugrīva to convey his presence to Rāma immediately because he is afraid he may become "Rākṣasa-minded" any time, and in the correct mindset he has at the moment, he would like to perform śaraṇāgati

The exact words he uses are: **rāghavāya mahātmane, sarvaloka śaraṇyāya (6.17.17)**, he uses these adjectives for Rāma, when asking Sugrīva as for to whom he should be conveying. These 3 adjectives convey the 2 qualities of paratvam and saulabhyam of the śaraṇya

**sarvalokaśarṇyāya** - Not only does it signify paratva, but also Bhagavān's easy access
<br />
**rāghavā** - saulabhyam, as mentioned before
<br />
**mahātma** - paratva

## Note

There's so much more I could write, and maybe I will in a different post or extend this itself.

The backbone of this post is notes from a upanyāsam of Sri Velukkudi Krishnan
