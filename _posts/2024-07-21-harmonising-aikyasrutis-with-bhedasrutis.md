## Different ways to reconcile the Aikyaśrutis

Madhvācārya in his Aṇuvyākhyāna states the five ways to reconcile Aikyaśrutis

> **स्वातन्त्र्ये च विशिष्टत्वे स्थानमत्यैक्ययोरपि ।\
> सादृश्ये चैक्यवाक् सम्यक् सावकाशा यथष्टतः ।।**
>
> svatantratā (absolute independence), viśiṣṭatva (super excellence or power), aikya based on being present at one place, or "being in absolute harmony of views with one another(?)" or similarity.

Padmanābhatīrtha gives examples in his Sannyāyaratnāvalī. We speak of the leader in absolute control of the village as the village itself (**अयं ग्रामः स्वयमेव, राजा राष्ट्रम्** etc). Similar is the śruti when it says "**विश्वमेवेदम् पुरुषः**"

The most outstanding scholar of the town is often spoken as the one and only scholar in the town (**अस्मिन् ग्रामे अयमेव पण्डितः**). "The cows have all become one in the shed" etc., also show aikya based on the place

## The flaw in the Advaitin interpretation of Śāstra

It is the "advaita śrutis" which are sāvakāśa, while bheda śrutis are niravakāśa - i.e., do not admit any other meaning but in their expressed sense (like dvā suparṇa). Because, if the abhedaśruti is held taken at face value, then the only way to reconcile with the bhedaśrutis - which also are in agreement with Pratyakṣa, an Upajīvyapramāṇa accepted by Śaṅkara himself in his <a target="_blank" href="https://www.gitasupersite.iitk.ac.in/srimad?language=dv&field_chapter_value=18&field_nsutra_value=66&scsh=1&setgb=1&etssa=1&choose=1#:~:text=Surely%2C%20even%20a,its%20own%20statement">Gītābhāṣya</a> - is by discarding it as Mithyā and carving through the entire śruti corpus for a non-uniform, **hierarchical** interpretation based on different layers of reality.

This is exactly what the Advaita Siddhānta posits - that the bheda is in terms of mithyābheda or vyāvahārikabheda. But this is just, crudely speaking, discarding of pratyakṣa - the upajīvyapramāṇa - and positing the abheda śrutis as supreme while the others only as mithyā - and hence of lesser in importance, creating a division across śāstra. Madhvācārya has given equal importance to the (so-called) advaita śrutis as well, but only that they have to be interpreted properly.

## The "Anuvādaka" claim on the Bhedaśrutis

Advaitins also say that, the Bhedaśrutis are anuvādaka - repetitive. Due to the bhedaśrutis saying what is already known through pratyakṣa, the bhedaśrutis do not contain any novelty (apūrvatā), and are hence just anuvāda. The abheda śrutis on the other hand, convey a novelty. "*But we cannot be carried away by novelty **for the sake of novelty itself**. We CANNOT accept that which is apramāṇika in the name of novelty. Otherwise even śūṇyatā can be accepted as a novelty*"

Further, as a criticism against this claimn to say that the bheda is anuvādaka - can we establish the Īśvara-Jīvabheda solely on pratyakṣa? To know that an entity is different from another based on observation alone, we have to know both the entities through the self-same pratyakṣapramāṇa. Or, to know that Jīva is indeed different from Brahman, we have to know the qualities of Brahman itself, which is **only known through the śrutis**. Hence the Bhedaśrutis themselves become upajīvyaśrutis.
