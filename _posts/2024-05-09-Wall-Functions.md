Continuing from the (<a target="_blank" href="https://aurvadahana.github.io/posts/turbulent-boundary-layers/">post</a> about derivation of the logarithmic region of the turbulent boundary layer, this post aims to elaborate on how CFD codes compute the wall shear stress for various scenarios of mesh refinement.
