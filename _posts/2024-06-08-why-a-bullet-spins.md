## Stability and Centre of Gravity

First of all, the center of gravity of an object is a point where the net weight of the object **appears** to act, and is not actually acting in the "real" world. This makes it easier for calculation and qualititative understanding of general physics related to the same.

Stability refers to how "stable" a system is, in this context, with respect to gravity. An object is in **Stable equilibrium** if any kind of external moment (or, displacement) which acts on the body causes the body to tend to return to its original position before being disturbed.

For example, a cone is placed on a flat surface with its circular shape as the base. Any small displacements tend to restore the cone back to its original position due to the counteracting moment on it. This moment is the couple created due to the loss of collinearity between the reaction force (which acts on the area of contact between object and flat surface), and the weight (which acts downwards from the center of gravity).
