Krishna's birth is a much talked of or commented upon event by Vaiṣṇavas; some very beautifully, bringing out the sweetness of the līlā. I could find them aplenty in the Nālāyira DP and other Viśiṣṭādvaita literature, but here I would like to highlight a little from the dvaita canon; particularly from the Rukmiṇīśavijaya, composed by my second favourite Mādhva Ācārya - Vādirāja Tīrtha.

From Bhagavān's birth, till his arrival till Vṛndāvana, Vādirāja has written the kāvya in such a "layman" bhāva which not many other Mādhvācāryas had attempted so before him, but with no compromise on the Mādhva tenets, rather he writes in such a way to bring the philosophy out of a sweet lens.

##  Reason for Avatāra

First of all, why did he decide to take the avatāra? Why at this tithi and nakṣatra? As is for anything related to Bhagavān, there are multitude of reasons for any līlās he does.

The direct reason cited as per the Bhāgavata Purāṇa is the request by Bhūmīdevī (not the consort of Bhagavān, but Abhimānī devatā of Earth), who approached Caturmukha Brahmā who led her to Bhagavān. The advent of Kaliyuga was near, and the eternal feud between the daitya-dānavas and devas continued its way on to earth, with several of those taking their own avatāras within humankind (which eventually led to the Mahabhārata). This was an immense "burden" on her back.

Infact these daityas are mentioned to be the re-incarnations of the same kṣatriyas slaughtered by Jāmadagnya Paraśurāma

> **यथा च जामदग्न्येन कोटिशः क्षत्रिया हताः ।**
>
> **उद्भूता राजवंशेषु ये भूयो भारते हताः ।। (Mahābhārata Śāntiparva 49.2)**
>
> Listen to the story of how millions of Kshatriyas were slain by Jamadagni's son and how those that sprung again in the diverse royal races in Bhārata were again slaughtered

Also, the two dvārapālas of Bhagavān - Jaya and Vijaya - were cursed to 3 lives of dispute with Bhgavān due to their hostility against the Mānasaputras of Brahmā. Vijaya took his lives as - Hiraṇyākṣa, Kumbhakarṇa and Dantavakra; while Jaya took lives as Hiraṇyakaśipu, Rāvaṇa and Śisupāla. It was Bhagavān's duty to fulfill the wishes of these two devotees and let them back to Vaikuṇṭha.

Definitely, many other little reasons are mentioned within the Vaiṣṇava purāṇas and Mahābharata, involving the previous lifes/karmas of Devakī, Yaśodā, Vasudeva, Pāṇḍavas, Draupadī etc.

But most of all, he took his avatāra to grace his devotees with his presence and līlās, for harikathāśravaṇa is as sweet, if not more, as listening to the sacred and harmonious Sāmaveda.

## Tithi and Nakṣatra

Krishna was born in the Aṣṭamī tithi when the moon was waning, when the moon was cohabiting with the his favourite wife, the Rohiṇī Nakṣatra - which is completely inside the Vṛṣabha constellation. As one can calculate, the moon decreases its angular distance with the sun by about 12° in every (waning) tithi, and by Aṣṭamī the moon is about 90 degrees ahead of the sun. So during midnight of a Kṛṣṇapakṣa Aṣṭamī tithi, when the sun is right below us, the moon would be rising in the east 90 degrees ahead of the sun. And that's when Krishna was born.

Vādirāja Tīrtha says the reason Bhagavān chose the Rohiṇī Nakṣatra was to honour His bhakta Ādiśeṣa, who as Balarāma had chosen Rohiṇī as his mother in his current avatāra.

Furthermore, he argues that as Lakṣmaṇa, Śeṣa had accumulated so much puṇya serving Rāma and Sītā ("<a target="_blank" href="https://aurvadahana.github.io/posts/a-few-points-on-saranagati/#lakshmana_sharanagati">**ahaṃ sarvaṃ kariṣyāmī**</a>") that he had puṇya more than is allowed in his station of the tāratamya. And so, Bhagavān asks him to take form as his elder brother this time, so that his own puṇya is brought down to the level of his station.

In this regard, it is worth noting the bhāva of the Viśiṣṭādvaitins, who talk of how Bhagavān was so pleased with Lakṣmaṇa's service that he chose to be born as the younger brother this time, to mimic his own devotee in performing service; just as he mimicked Hanumān by lifting the Govardhana hill.

Also, Maṇavāḷa Māmunigaḷ <a target="_blank" href="https://divyaprabandham.koyil.org/index.php/2016/06/ramanusa-nurranthadhi-23/">comments</a> on Periya Koil Nambi's ராமானுஜ நூற்றந்தாதி (Rāmānuja Nuṭṭantādi) as to how they're confused whether Rāmānujācārya is the claimed Ādiśeṣa's avatāra or Bhagavān himself, because while Ādiśeṣa took form as Rāmānuja (Lakṣmaṇa), Bhagavān also took form as Rāmānuja (Kṛṣṇa as Balarāma's brother). So who indeed is Rāmānuja?

## Birth of "Ajaḥ", the Unborn

Enough digressing. Sri Vādirāja then also addresses why Krishna is not to be seen as the "son" of Devakī and Vasudeva. How can he who is **Aja**, the unborn (or he who is never born), be seen so? Especially when Devakī and Vasudeva themselves deny their parenthood with several stutis which brings out this baby's supremacy?

This is what Devakī says to Krishna

> **विश्वं यदेतत् स्वतनौ निशान्ते यथावकाशं पुरुष: परो भवान् ।**
>
> **बिभर्ति सोऽयं मम गर्भगोऽभूदहो नृलोकस्य विडम्बनं हि तत् ॥ (Bhāgatava Purāṇa 10.3.31)**
>
> "That your Lordship, the Supreme Person who con¬ tains within yourself all this universe in extenso at the end of the cosmic night (during Pralaya), should get himself accommodated in my womb is certainly a wonderful imitation of the human (ways of the) world.”

Vasudeva too makes similar statements.

One of the reasons of Bhagavān being called "Putra" is this: As per the smṛtis, the Son delivers his father from the hell called ‘Put’ by Śrādha etc. karmas, therefore has he is called ‘Putra'. And since Bhagavān delivers all from all hinds of hell, he is certainly called a 'Putra' to all his devotees.

> **पुन्नाम्नो नरकाद् यस्मात् त्रायते पितरं सुतः । तस्मात् पुत्र इति प्रोक्तः ... ।। (Manusmṛti 9.138)**

But there is another reason for this. One of the most trademark guṇas of Bhagavān is his Saulabhyam, his ease of accessibility. WHen the gopālas witness Krishna's līlās, they approach him with doubt, as to whether he is merely a man.

> **देवो वा दानवो वा त्वं यक्षो गन्धर्व्व एव वा ।**
>
> **किं वास्माकं विचारेण बान्धवोऽसि नमोऽस्तु ते ।। (Viṣṇupurāṇa 5.13.8)**
>
>  Reverence to thee; whether thou be a god, or a demon, or a Yakṣa, or a Gandharva, or whatever we may deem thee; for thou art our friend.

To which Krishna replies, hurt and irritated:

> **नाहं देवो न गन्धर्व्वो न यक्षो न च दानवः ।**
>
> **अहं वो बान्धवो जातो नास्ति चिन्त्यमतोऽन्यथा ।। (VP 5.13.12)**
>
> I am neither a god, nor Yakṣa, nor Gandharva, nor Dānava; I have been born your relative, and you must not think differently of me.

He's quite child-like that he even goes against the vedas just so he could appear as an equal to his bhaktas. And in a similar vein, he identifies as a son to Devakī and Vasudeva as well.

As for his being **Aja**, he is unborn in the context that he is not born due to prārabdha karma, but born of his own icchā, even without a womb like Narasiṃha's birth from a pillar. All his forms are eternal, including forms of Krishna at various stages of his life. They manifest when he desires so. He chose Devakī to grace her for a previous karma (I won't go to it now), and hence he is not born in the traditional sense.
