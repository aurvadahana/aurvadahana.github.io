Krishna's birth is a very talked of or commented upon event by Vaiṣṇavas; some very beautifully, bringing out the sweetness of the līlā. I could find them aplenty in the Nālāyira DP and other Viśiṣṭādvaita literature, but here I would like to highlight a little from the dvaita canon; particularly from the Rukmiṇīśavijaya, composed by my second favourite Mādhva Ācārya - Vādirāja Tīrtha.

From Bhagavān's birth, till his arrival till Vṛndāvana, Vādirāja has written the kāvya in such a "layman" bhāva which not many other Mādhvācāryas had attempted so before him, but with no compromise on the Mādhva tenets, rather he writes in such a way to bring the philosophy out of a sweet lens.

## Birth of "Ajaḥ", the Unborn

Krishna was born in the Aṣṭamī tithi when the moon is waning, when the moon was cohabiting with the Rohiṇī Nakṣatra which is completely inside the Vṛṣabha constellation. As we could calculate, the moon decreases its angular distance with the sun by about 12° in every waning tithi, and by Aṣṭamī the moon is about 90 degrees ahead of the sun. 90 degrees for the sun is about 6 hours; so when the sun is right below us, the time would be ~midnight, and the moon would just be rising. And that's when Krishna was born.

Enough digressing. Sri Vādirāja first addresses why Krishna is not to be seen as the "son" of Devakī and Vasudeva. How can he who is **Aja**, the unborn (or he who is never born), be seen so? Especially when Devakī and Vasudeva themselves deny their parenthood with several stutis which brings out this baby's supremacy?

This is what Devakī says to Krishna

> **विश्वं यदेतत् स्वतनौ निशान्ते यथावकाशं पुरुष: परो भवान् ।**
>
> **बिभर्ति सोऽयं मम गर्भगोऽभूदहो नृलोकस्य विडम्बनं हि तत् ॥ (Bhāgatava Purāṇa 10.3.31)**
>
> "That your Lordship, the Supreme Person who con¬ tains within yourself all this universe in extenso at the end of the cosmic night (during Pralaya), should get himself accommodated in my womb is certainly a wonderful imitation of the human (ways of the) world.”

Vasudeva too makes similar statements.

One of the reasons of Bhagavān being called "Putra" is this: As per the smṛtis, the Son delivers his father from the hell called ‘Put’ by Śrādha etc. karmas, therefore has he is called ‘Putra'. And since Bhagavān delivers all from all hinds of hell, he is certainly called a 'Putra' to all his devotees.

> **पुन्नाम्नो नरकाद् यस्मात् त्रायते पितरं सुतः । तस्मात् पुत्र इति प्रोक्तः ... ।। (Manusmṛti 9.138)**

But there is another reason for this. One of the most trademark guṇas of Bhagavān is his Saulabhyam, his ease of accessibility. WHen the gopālas witness Krishna's līlās, they approach him with doubt, as to whether he is merely a man.

> **देवो वा दानवो वा त्वं यक्षो गन्धर्व्व एव वा ।**
>
> **किं वास्माकं विचारेण बान्धवोऽसि नमोऽस्तु ते ।। (Viṣṇupurāṇa 5.13.8)**
>
>  Reverence to thee; whether thou be a god, or a demon, or a Yakṣa, or a Gandharva, or whatever we may deem thee; for thou art our friend.

To which Krishna replies, hurt and irritated:

> **नाहं देवो न गन्धर्व्वो न यक्षो न च दानवः ।**
>
> **अहं वो बान्धवो जातो नास्ति चिन्त्यमतोऽन्यथा ।। (VP 5.13.12)**
>
> I am neither a god, nor Yakṣa, nor Gandharva, nor Dānava; I have been born your relative, and you must not think differently of me.

He's quite child-like that he even goes against the vedas just so he could appear as an equal to his bhaktas. And in a similar vein, he identifies as a son to Devakī and Vasudeva as well.

As for his being **Aja**, he is unborn in the context that he is not born due to prārabdha karma, but born of his own icchā, even without a womb like Narasiṃha's birth from a pillar. All his forms are eternal, including forms of Krishna at various stages of his life. They manifest when he desires so. He chose Devakī to grace her for a previous karma (I won't go to it now), and hence he is not born in the traditional sense.
