A twitter user recently asked what was the purpose of creation by Bhagavān if he himself is without any deficiencies. The first part of the question is something very basic we all would've wondered about (we all do know Bhagavān is without any deficiencies and thus any act of his, including sṛṣṭi, is not for any purpose of gain for him). As I have always maintained, questions are like the churning of the ocean, and each question is like an ocean of knowledge.


The view with regard to this is presented by the sūtrakāra in the naprayojanādhikaraṇam (2.1.33-34). Before that, one should note that Śrī Madhva has his own categorisation of the sūtras into adhikaraṇas as is meant by the sūtrakāra. For both Śaṅkara and Rāmānuja, the sūtras in discussion here are 32nd and 33rd.


While both Śaṅkara and Rāmānuja treat the first sūtra as pūrvapakṣa, Madhva sees them both as siddhānta.


> **ॐ न प्रयोजनवत्त्वात् ॐ** 

"None being accomplished", i.e., the activities of creation etc of the Lord does not proceed from any particular reason or benefit to Himself. When He himself is supreme and complete in himself, what is the reason for him to perform any creation for himself?


Then why does he engage in sṛṣṭi? The next sūtra clarifies this


> **ॐ लोकवत्तुलीलाकैवल्यम् ॐ** 

"But from mere līlā"

Śrī Madhva quotes the Nārāyaṇasaṃhitā which says that just as a mad-man in absolute ecstasy dances in a blissful state, so does bhagavān, who has pūrṇānanda as his eternal state, engages in सृष्ट्यादि activities. What purpose does he have for himself in this state of eternal bliss as an āptakāma?


>**सृष्ट्यादिकं हरिर्नैव प्रयोजनपेक्ष्य तु** **|**
>
>**कुरुते केवलानन्दाद्यथा मत्तस्य नर्तनम्**
>
>**पूर्णानन्दस्य तस्येह प्रयोजनमितिः कुतः**
>
>**मुक्ता अप्याप्तकामाः स्युः किमु तस्याखिलात्मनः**


Śrī Rāmānuja clarifies that the Lord engages in creation merely for sport, as a king of all the saptadvīpas engages in a game of balls merely as a sport.

As Śrī Jayatīrtha points out in his Nyāyasudhā (and as Śrī Rāmānuja in the 35th sūtra), these acts are solely for the benefit of the souls and NOT for any of himself. 

Everytime the time for creations arrive, Śrīdevī in her form as Durgā praises the Lord with the hymns of Śrutigītā, asking Him to begin the process of creation for the sake of the jīvas to be released. It is hence, for the benefit of jīvas, for them to exhaust their karma and realise their svarūpa and relationship with bhagavān. 


The Māṇḍūkya śruti says


> **भोगार्थं सृष्टिरित्यन्ये क्रीडार्थमिति चापरे**
>
> **देवस्यैष स्वभावोऽयमाप्तकामस्य का स्पृहा** (15)

> "Some think the creation is for the enjoyment of the Lord (bhogārtham), while some think it is for a sport (krīḍārtham). However, it is the very nature of the God to create (devasyaiṣa svabhāvaḥ). He whose desires are fulfilled cannot have any desire (for himself)"


Jayatīrtha says that the adjective Āptakāma here is used as a "hetugarbhaviśeṣaṇa" (an adjective containing an implicit reason), that it does not rule out all desire, but that there is not any personal benefit for bhagavān to be gained from this process. 


It is hence the very svabhāva of bhagavān to engage in these activities. Like the movement of hands and feet of a baby drinking mother's milk or the upward movement of flames. To be in the state of pūrṇānanda is the very svabhāva of Bhagavān.


Moreover, this is not an act of difficulty for Bhagavān. The previous śrutivākya from Māṇḍūkya says - **icchāmātraṃ prabhoḥ sṛṣṭiḥ** - merely by the will of bhagavān. It is child's play for him, almost nothing. Like the example quoted above, like a man is shaking his hands, it is his svabhāva which takes no effort from his part.


The purpose of the creative activities of Bhagavān, hence, does not extend to just the act of creation, sustenance and dissolution as is pointed out by Śaṅkara and Rāmānuja. In the Janmādyadhikaraṇam (1.1.2) Śrī Madhva hence quotes the following pramāṇa from Skandapurāṇa.


> **उत्पत्तिस्थितिसंहारा नियतिर्ज्ञानमावृतिः**
>
> **बन्धमोक्षौ च पुरुषाद्यस्मात् स हरिरेकराट्**


Hence Madhva holds the view that apart from utpatti-sthiti-saṃhāra, even niyamana (order), jñāna (enlightenment), āvṛti (obscuration), bandha (bondage) and mokṣa also proceed from the unconditioned Hari.
