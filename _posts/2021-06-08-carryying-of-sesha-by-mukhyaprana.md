After Lakṣmaṇa became unconscious by the arrow used by Rāvaṇa, he regained his senses and remembered his own form of Śeṣa and Hari-aṃśa (of Saṅkarṣaṇa) and Rāvaṇa was unable to even shake him.

> Rāvaṇa started pulling Lakṣmaṇa forcefully with all of his twenty arms. The entire earth along with Meru, Mandarā and all the oceans shook. But Lakṣmaṇa did not move even a bit.

Śrī Madhva says, when the entire earth along with all the lokas and the giri-samudras placed on but one hood of the thousand-hooded Ādiśeṣa resembles but a mustard seed to him, then who can lift him?

It is only Mukhyaprāṇa who can.

Hanumān suddenly arrives, defeats Rāvaṇa and lifts Lakṣmaṇa to safety.

Śrī Vādirāja Tīrtha in his Bhūgoḷavarṇanam writes it is Mukhyaprāṇa in his **Kūrmarūpa-Vāyukūrma** who has always carried Ādiśeṣa underneath the earth in the region of Ghanodaka (thick-water region, which is one of the regions mentioned by him). The tail of Ādiśeṣa rests on this kūrma, and he lifts one of his thousand hoods to support the sarvalokas and to prevent it from drowing in Ghanodaka. This has earned him the name sarvalokadhurandharaḥ.

There are quite a few mentions of a kūrma carrying Ādiśeṣa in purāṇas.

Brahmavaivarta Purāṇa (Prakṛti-Khaṇḍa, 34) mentions how Vāyu carries kūrma and the latter in turn holds Śeṣa on him who carries the earth along with all the oceans, seven continents and parvatas

The Vaiṣṇava-Khaṇḍa of Skanda Purāna mentions of a Śrī Varāha mantra in which the dhyānam is of Śrī Varāha stationed over a lotus over the body of Śeṣa who is lying on the middle of the back of the divine Kūrma.

)**

The below image of this same dhyāna is from the sankṣipta skandapurāṇa of Gītāpress

_An interesting depiction of Kūrma carrying sarvalokas including the diśāgajas. One can wonder what the snake represents, whether it is śeṣa or not._
