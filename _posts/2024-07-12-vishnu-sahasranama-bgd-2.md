### 10. पूतात्मा / Pūtātmā - The Pure Self [[ot]](#ot10), [[f1]](#ff1)

**ॐ पूतात्मने नमः**

<div id="ff2r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

Though Bhagavān is the Soul of all objects, unlike the individual souls He is not affected by the defects of the Sentient and non-sentient objects which are His body. That is, He is pure by nature. Though the contact with the body is similar to both Paramātmā and Jivātmā, the lower soul (**अवर (एव)आत्मा** i.e. the individual soul) alone reaps the fruits of his actions and is subject to suffering. The Śruti declares — 'The other Aja (unborn, i.e. Jivātmā) leaves it after it has been enjoyed. But the Supreme Soul (Paramātmā) who makes the other experience joy or sorrow because of His free will and independence, not only does not enjoy it, but also shines brilliantly" [[10.1]](#f101), [[f2]](#ff2). This can be explained by an analogy: when a teacher beats a student with a cane, the contact with the cane is the same both for the teacher and the student. It is only the student who is beaten that experiences the pain of the beating, but not the teacher who beats.

This is taught to us by various texts -

"The other (Paramātmā) Who does not eat, shines with ail brilliance." [[10.2]](#f102)

“He is the Inner soul of all beings and is devoid of all sins" [[10.3]](#f103)

"Actions do not taint Me" [[10.4]](#f104)

“Nārada! Look at the superiority and greatness of the Lord (Paramātmā), who is never tainted by actions, good or bad." [[10.5]](#f105)

<div id="ff3r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

The Brahmasūtra says: "(Then) if it be said that (the two) should equally partake (of the experiences), it is to be denied on account of the difference" [[10.6]](#f106), [[f3]](#ff3)

<div id="tr11" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

### 11. परमात्मा / Paramātmā - The Supreme Soul [[ot]](#ot11)

**ॐ परमात्मने नमः**

<div id="ff4r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

Unlike all beings which have Him as their Inner Soul, paramātmā does not have any one as His Inner Soul (Ātmā). Therefore Bhagavān is called Parama-ātmā. The word 'Parama' is derived thus: '**परो मा अस्य**' meaning 'He who has no one superior to Him; The form 'parama' is grammatically correct on the analogy of the word 'Pṛṣodara' [[11.1]](#f111), [[f4]](#ff4). Bhagavān is 'parama' (Supreme) and 'Ātmā' (Inner soul). That is to say there is no ruler above Him who controls Him.

The following passages establish this fact:

"He who is the Ruler of His own Ātmā" [[11.2]](#f112)

<div id="ff5r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

"There is that One, There is no one other (who is superior to Him)" [[11.3]](#f113), [[f5]](#ff5)

"Nothing is seen which is equal or superior to Him" [[11.4]](#f114)

<div id="ff6r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

"There is none Superior nor different from Him." [[11.5]](#f115), [[f6]](#ff6)

"The best of Bhāratas! Nothing is seen which is superior to the Lotus-eyed Lord” [[11.6]](#f116)

"Greater than the Lotus-eyed (Lord) there was nothing (in the past) nor will there be (in the future)" [[11.7]](#f117)

"There is no God greater than Keśava." [[11.8]](#f118)

"Nothing is higher than the Parama-Puruṣa, who is without end, beginning or middle." [[11.9]](#f119)

"Greater than Myself there is nothing else." [[11.10]](#f1110)

"There is no greater nectar than Bhagavān of Universal form." [[11.11]](#f1111)

"He is greater than the great. He is superior; and He is the Supreme Soul." [[11.12]](#f1112)

<div id="tr12" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

### 12. मुक्तानां परमागतिः / Muktānāṃ Paramāgatiḥ - He who is the Supreme goal for all the Muktas [[ot]](#ot12)

**ॐ मुक्तानां परमागतये नमः**

#### Part 1 - Who are Muktas?

This name says that He, who is (thus) the Supreme Śeṣī (Master) of all. is the highest goal.

They are called the Released Souls (**मुक्ताः**) who once for all and completely are free from the enshrouding coverings which are the results of the bondage of the Primordial Matter, nescience latent impressions of actions and their fruitions. (**प्रकृतिबन्ध-अविद्या-कर्म-संस्कार-रुचि.. आवरणेभ्यः**)

Here are some passages from the scriptures -

"(The upāsaka) casts off his merits and sins (Puṇya - pāpa)." [[12.1]](#f121)

"Even as a horse shakes its hair (to get rid of the dust), he casts off his sins." [[12.2]](#f122)

"Shaking off the merits and sins" [[12.3]](#f123)

"Then the learned upāsaka becomes freed from name and form" [[12.4]](#f124)

"When he realises Deva, he is released from all bonds" [[12.5]](#f125)

"The knot binding the heart is cut" [[12.6]](#f126)

"They cross this Māyā (i.e., Saṃsāra)" [[12.7]](#f127)

<div id="ff7r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

The Nārāyaṇīya of Mahabharata teaches - "Those, who are bereft of the seventeen qualities and actions, give up the fifteen ‘Kalās’ and become Released Souls. This is certain" [[12.8]](#f128), [[f7]](#ff7)

#### Part 2 - The inherent qualities of Muktas; the similarity with Bhagavaan

<div id="ff8r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

It has been established in the Scriptures that those, who have been freed from all the shackles of Saṃsāra attain equality with Paramātmā, the Supreme Soul, in regard to the essential nature which is full of unlimited knowledge and Bliss, and also in regard to the eight qualities beginning with "being devoid of all sins" (**अपहतपाप्मत्व**) and ending with "unfailing will" (**सत्यसङ्कल्पत्व**). [[f8]](#ff8)

"Witnessing the desired objects through his celestial eye and mind, he is happy" [[12.9]](#f129)

"Becoming devoid of all sins, he attains utmost equality with the Lord." [[12.3]](#f123)

"They attain a state of equality with me (like Myself in regard to the possession of auspicious qualities)." [[12.10]](#f1210)

<div id="ff9r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

"Bādarāyaṇa affirms that there is no contradiction between the two statements that the Mukta's essential nature is knowledge only and that they are endowed with many qualities. This is because of earlier statements according to which the pure soul is bereft of all blemishes, and full of auspicious qualities." [[12.11]](#f1211), [[f9]](#ff9)

#### Part 3 - The quality of Muktas w.r.t their bodies' similarity with Bhagavaan

It is further established that the Released Souls attain a Similarity with Paramātmā even in regard to their bodies which are composed of unmixed and supreme Sattvaguṇa (Śuddhasattva).

"He becomes one, (he becomes threefold)" [[12.12]](#f1212)

"He eats, plays and enjoys." [[12.13]](#f1213)

<div id="ff10r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

"He enjoys whatever he desires, assumes whatever form he wants and follows (The Lord)." [[12.14]](#f1214), [[f10]](#ff10)

"The fragrance of Brahman enters into him ... The taste of Brahman enters into him." [[12.15]](#f1215)

"The celestial damsels adorn him with the decorations of the Brahman Itself" [[12.16]](#f1216)

<div id="ff11r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

"Bādarāyaṇa holds the view that the Released Souls are in two forms (i.e. with a body or without a body as they like). It is like the Soma Sacrifice, 'Dvādaśāha' by name, which is to be done for twelve days and which is of two kinds (either with one master or many masters) or (either for prosperity or for progeny)" [[12.17]](#f1217), [[f11]](#ff11)

<div id="ff12r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

#### Part 4 - "Muktānām" - existence of multiple Muktas, not singular [[f12]](#ff12)

Here the word **मुक्तानाम्** used in the plural number shows clearly, that the Released souls are many and are different from one another. So do the Scriptures declare.

"All become free by the grace of the Paramapuruṣa." [[12.18]](#f1218)

"The worshippers of Paramapuruṣa become great and attain the Transcendent world of Bliss (Paramapada)" [[12.19]](#f1219)

"They attain a state of equality with Me in regard to the possession of auspicious qualities like Myself" [[12.10]](#f1210)

"They attain Me" [[12.20]](#f1220)

#### Part 5 - Brahma-(Mukta)Jīvabheda

As it is stated here itself that 'He is a witness' (**Sākṣī** - in names [15](#tr15) and 517) and that He is the object of attainment by the Muktas (Released Souls), it is clear that there is a difference between Bhagavān and the Released Souls. So do the Scriptures declare -

"When that bird - which has sorrow (i.e., the upāsaka) - sees the other bird (the Lord) as being pleased with him and also realises His greatness, he becomes bereft of all sorrow." [[12.21]](#f1221)

"When he understands that the Ātman (Individual Soul) (which is driven about) and He (Paramātmā), (who drives him) are different (it attains Amṛtatva)." [[12.22]](#f1222)

"The Released Soul attains the Paramapuruṣa." [[12.4]](#f124)

"The Released Soul enjoys all bliss along with the omniscient Brahman." [[12.23]](#f1223)

"He attains the Lord of Supreme Effulgence." [[12.24]](#f1224)

"It is stated that Paramātmā is attained by the Released Soul" [[12.25]](#f1225)

#### Part 6 - Brahmajīvabheda elaborated; how to interpret the different śrutivākyas accordingly

It is also clearly stated in Mokṣadharma:

<div id="ff13r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

"He is Lord Nārāyaṇa and He must be known as the Supreme Puruṣa and the Inner Soul of all beings. Just as the lotus leaf is not tainted by water, He is not tainted by any dirt (i.e. blemish). He, who is the other, is known as Karmātmā and is the victim of bondage and release. He becomes associated with all the seventeen (qualities)." [[12.26]](#f1226), [[f13]](#ff13)

<div id="ff14r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

From all these, this theory is dispelled by the Śāstras themselves; the theory being that: Brahman Itself, circumscribed by a real or unreal upādhi (i.e., a limiting adjunct) becomes a prey to the worldly miseries like the ether circumscribed in a vessel, and that there is absolutely no difference in the state of Release between the Supreme Brahman and the released souls. Because of this absolute similarity between the Paramātmā and the Jīvātmās, statements like, "He who knows Brahman becomes Brahman Itself" [[12.27]](#f1227) which speak of non-difference between the two are reconciled with the other view that those two are different [[f14]](#ff14).

This is in analogy with the statement: "This is a cow", in regard to those which have broken horns or without horns. That is, all the cows under the genus of cows are called as such though there is an external difference - some having broken horns and some not so. In the case of those who say that there is Abheda, statements which affirm nop-difference and which affirm similarity between Brahmah and Jīvas in the state of Release will contradict each other.

#### Part 7 - Upādhis for Muktas

Aupādhikabheda-vādīs [[f15]](#ff15) accept that there is an end to the entity of the Mukta or Released Souls. In that case the state of Release will cease to be an object to be desired or longed for; again, it will be against the statements that declare the *existence of difference in the state of Release*. The supreme similarity (between the Paramātmā and the Mukta) which we have delineated has been described as non-difference. So the non-difference delineated in the Upaniṣads - the Abheda - refers only to the similarity of the qualities and not to the non-existence of the entity of Mukta as such.

The Viṣṇu Purāṇa says -

<div id="ff16r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

> “**तद्भावभावम् आपन्नः तदाऽसौ परमात्मना ।
> भवत्यभेदी……**”

This verse seems to be conveying a state of Abheda (Refer [[12.28]](#f1228)), but Bhaṭṭar explains why the use of the word "**भावः**" twice makes that interpretation (of Abheda) "vyarthaḥ". He quotes from the commentary of Viṣṇucitta Āḻvān of the Viṣṇupurāṇa. Read in more detail at [[f16]](#ff16).

The prohibition of difference in the state of Release (**मुक्तौ भेद-निषेधः**) has been indicated to be with reference to the limiting adjuncts such as gods and the like (**देवादि उपाधिविषयः**)—

"There is no longer the difference in the form of gods and the like (as Upādhis); that shroud (i. e. Karma, which has been concealing the similarity between the Jīva and the Paramātmā) has been dispelled.


#### Part 8 - Elaboration on the word "गतिः"

This word 'gati' has at its end the suffix '**क्तिन्**' [[f17]](#ff17) in the sense of the passive. '**गतिः**' means attainment ("**प्राप्तिः**"). A word in the Accusative case (i.e. objective case) refers to an object which is most desired; and that is the goal of attainment. By this it is shown that the relationship between the Released Soul and Paramātmā, the object of attainment, is that of servant and master (**शेषशेषिभावः**).

The Śrutis say -

"Having attained the Supreme Soul (Paramātmā) full of bliss" [[12.14]](#f1214)

"(The Mukta) follows Him". [[12.14]](#f1214)

"By that path by which Paramātmā moves, by the same path the Mukta goes with Him. This is similar to a young cow going after its calf or a calf following its mother-cow." [[12.30]](#f1230)

"Like the shadow of an object that goes with the object wherever it goes." [[12.30]](#f1230)

In the same manner (does the Mukta follow the Paramātmā).

#### Part 9 - The inherent qualities of the Jīvātmā

It is from the Scriptures that we know about the existence of Jīvātmā and Paramātmā. The same scriptures reveal that thet Jīvātmā is ’Seṣa' or subordinate to Paramātmā and that this subjection is natural to the Jīvātmā like knowledge and other qualities of his; and in the state of Release this attribute of subjection is not negatived. On the other hand because of the removal of obstruction, it becomes manifest.

"He becomes endowed with the form natural to him (which was concealed till now)" [[12.24]](#f1224)

Viṣṇudharma also states :

"Just as the radiance of a gem is not newly created, (but only made manifest) when the dirt on the gem is removed by.polishing, so too knowledge and other qualities of the soul become bereft of Karma. For knowledge and other such qualities are indeed quite natural to him (and are always there though latent at some times (i.e. in Saṃsāra).

Oh the Ruler of Men! Knowledge and non-attachment, riches and virtue (**ज्ञान-वैराग्य-ऐश्वर्य-धर्म**) all these four qualities are eternally present in the Jīvātmā who is like Brahman itself because of his similarity." [[12.31]](#f1231)

The Brahmasūtra also confirms this: "When tha Mukta attains the Brahman, there is the manifestation of his essential nature which is his own. This is revealed by the use of the word '**स्वेन**' ("his own" - as an adjective qualifying the noun **रूपेण** - his essential nature or form)" [[12.32]](#f1232)

#### Part 10 - On the objection that the Jīvātmā becomes independent on Mokṣa (based on Śrutivākyas)

Here an objection is raised : "He attains independence" [[12.33]](#f1233); "He becomes a sovereign" [[12.34]](#f1234). After quoting these texts, the independent status of a Mukta is established by the following Brahmasūtra; "For that very reason he has none as (his) lord" ("**अनन्याधिपतिः**") [[12.35]](#f1235). Against all this, how can it be said that he exists for the benefit of another and how can the undesirable state of a dependent be predicated about him?

Dunce! Don't become an object of ridicule. Here the import of the word '**अनन्याधिपतित्वम्**' (i.e. being without another master) is that He is under the control of Bhagavan *only*, who is His own Master. The domination of other things like, distress and karma ("**क्लेशकर्मादि**") over the Mukta has been removed. This does not mean that he is an '**अनाथ**' (i. e. one without a master to save him). If that were the case, the word '**अनाधिपति**' ("without a master") would have been used, and not '**अनन्याधिपति**' ("without another master"). In the case of a wife, being subject to a greatly loving husband is not loathsome to her; for we see that even kings and others are eagerly served and subserved by their sweethearts and others when they do what is most pleasing to them. Again and again it has been indicated that it is the qualities that occupy a place of importance (and not any thing else). It has been established in the Brahmasūtras that the equality between the Paramātmā and the Jīvātmā is only with reference to the enjoyment of Bliss and excludes the state of being the ruler on the one hand and the ruled on the other.

"The Jīvātmā is like the Paramātmā Himself except with reference to the activities regarding the Universe, viz. its creation, destruction etc." [[12.36]](#f1236)

"There are clear indications to show that the equality of the Jīvātmā and Paramātmā is only in the enjoyment of Supreme Bliss" [[12.37]](#f1237)

#### Part 11 - Dependence, subjection and servitude of Jīvas to Bhagavān is natural and even desirous in the Released state - comparison of Muktas with the residents of Śvetadvīpa

Here are other texts in suppport of this view -

Śrī Viṣṇutattva - "The Mukta attains complete subjection to Paramapuruṣa. He gets rid of all bondage and attains unparalleled freedom. He enjoys all Bliss along with the Paramapuruṣa" [[12.38]](#f1238)

"With the Jīvātmā rests the state of being a property (that is possessed); and the state of being the owner or possessor rests with Paramātmā. This is the relationship between the two. Nothing else appeals to me.” [[12.38]](#f1238)

Śrī Nārāyaṇīya (Mokṣadharmaparva)

"At the end of the observance of our vow, we saw men with highly auspicious qualities, white, bright like the moon and endowed with all lovely features. Their hands were joined in prayer at all times, and they were meditating upon the Brahman with their faces turned towards north east" [[12.39]](#f1239)

"With their hands joined in prayer they are always happy and are always repeating the word '**नमः**' (which means salutations unto Thee)". [[12.40]](#f1240)

"They have controlled the sense-organs, and remain without food. They do not perspire and are always sweet smelling" [[12.41]](#f1241)

These and other such texts describe the residents of Śvetadvīpa and say that they are endowed with divine features and the like, and they derive great pleasure in being the servants of the Lord and in doing unceasing service to Him. The same is said to be the state and occupation of the Muktas or Released Souls.

This is reiterated by the following text:

"The best among the Bhāratas! Those men who are released from here have the same characteristics as those who ere the residents of Śvetadvīpa" [[12.42]](#f1242)

#### Part 12 - एवं मुक्तानां परमागतिः

By the use of the word '**परमा**' (highest) as an adjective qualifying '**गतिः**' (goal) (in the phrase '**परमागतिः**) it should be understood that there are some for whom the goal is of a lower order. Such a goal, which goes by the name of Kaivalya [[f18]](#ff18), is resorted to by those souls who are free from old age, death etc. (Śrī Kṛṣṇa says in the Gītā)- "They resort to me and make efforts to be devoid of old age and death." [[12.43]](#f1243)

It is stated that such a place of theirs (Kaivalya by name) is somewhere between Saṃsāra and Paramapada.

"That is the eternal world of those yogins who are satisfied with enjoyment of the Bliss of their own individual soul." [[12.44]](#f1244)

Such is the Supreme Goal of the Muktas ("एवं **मुक्तानां परमागतिः**")

"He is the Highest means; He is the Supreme Goal." [[12.45]](#f1245)

"He who is the inner Soul of the universe and the highest goal." [[11.2]](#f112)

"(They attain) Me, the unsurpassed Goal" [[12.46]](#f1246)

"He reaches the end of the road (i.e. Paramātmā)." [[12.47]](#f1247)

"There is nothing greater than the attainment of the (Supreme) AAtman." [[12.48]](#f1248)

Texts like these can be easily got.

<div id="tr13" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

That Bhagavān is the Supreme Goal of attainment for the Muktas is corroborated by the next five names (13 to 17) [[f19]](#ff19).

### 13. अव्ययः / Avyayaḥ - He by whom the Muktas are not sent away [[ot]](#ot13), [[f20]](#ff20)

**ॐ अव्ययाय नमः**

The word is derived from the verb '**न वीयते**' His name is Avyayaḥ, because no one is sent away by Him. The suffix added is '**एरच्**' [[f21]](#ff21). The names 'Pratyayaḥ' (94), 'Vinayaḥ' (510), 'Jayaḥ' (511) and the like belong to this group (which has this particular suffix). Is it not a well-known fact that the Bhagavān never sends back that Ātmā who has, by some means and with great effort, crossed the vast ocean of Saṃsāra and has reached His lotus-feet? That is why the Vedas declare -

"They who go by this path (i.e. Arcirādigati) attain Bhagavān and do not come back to this mortal world." [[13.1]](#f131)

"He does not return; he does not return" [[13.2]](#f132)

<div id="ff22r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

"There is no return according to the scripture. There is no return according to Scripture" [[13.3]](#f133), [[f22]](#ff22)

Yamasmṛti says -

"The Mukta bears a body of pure and subtle Sattva and attains the Supreme Lord who is the Paramātmāa and Nārāyaṇa, as well as the glorious and superior Vaikuṇṭha. Then he becomes fit for immortality and does not come back (to this world) any more." [[13.4]](#f134)

Hārīta dealing with yati-dharma (the code of the Sannyāsins) says -

"One who has taken to the life of a yati is calm, equally disposed towards all beings and self-controlled. He attains the highest place (i.e., Vaikuṇṭha) and after reaching it never comes back" [[13.5]](#f135)

<div id="tr14" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

### 14. पुरुषः / Puruṣaḥ - The Generous Giver [[ot]](#ot14)

**ॐ पुरुषाय नमः**

He bestows gifts in plenty. '**पुरु**' means abundance, and '**सनोति**' the verb signifies the act of giving. The suffix '**डः**' is added (when the root '**सन्**' is preceded by the particle '**पुरु**'. The rule says that it is added even in the case of other particles) [[14.1]](#f141). Bhagavān indeed bestows even on the Muktas the enjoyment of the Bliss of Himself, His qualities and His glory - all of which are beyond the range of words and mind.

Here are the Vedic Mantras that reveal this -

"He (Bhagavān) alone confers Bliss" [[14.2]](#f142)

"He (The Mukta) enjoys all desirable things along with the omniscient Brahman." [[12.23]](#f1223)

"By his celestial eye and mind, he (the Mukta) sees all desirable things and enjoys." [[12.9]](#f129)

"There the Mukta enjoys all kinds of bliss. He eats, plays and experiences joy" [[12.13]](#f1213)

"He enjoys all that he desires and assumes whatever form he likes." [[12.14]](#f1214)

"He (The Parabrahman) is Itself Bliss. Having attained that Pararbrahman this Mukta becomes endowed with joy." [[14.2]](#f142)

"The Śāstras declare that the Mukta becomes endowed with joy when he attains the Brahman." [[14.3]](#f143)

<div id="ff23r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

"Bhagavān (who is Ānandamaya is said to be the source of Bliss for others (i.e. the individual souls)." [[14.4]](#f144), [[f23]](#ff23)

<div id="tr15" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

### 15. साक्षी / Sākṣī - He who sees them all directly [[ot]](#ot15)

**ॐ साक्षिणे नमः**

Bhagavān is known as "**साक्षी**" (witness) because He directly sees the Muktas enjoy the Bliss He has bestowed and He is also happy seeing them full of joy [[f24]](#ff24). The suffix '**इन्**' is added to the word **साक्षात्** according to a grammatical rule when the word so formed is a noun [[15.1]](#f151) - to show that the person is direct eye-witness to a particular act. The object of attainment by the Mukta, viz. Brahman, is specially delineatad by the Śruti as "Brahman, the Omniscient" [[12.23]](#f1223). Omniscience is explained as knowledge capable of cognising all things of varied nature.

### 16. क्षेत्रज्ञः / Kṣetrajñaḥ - The knower of the field for action [[ot]](#ot16)

**ॐ क्षेत्रज्ञाय नमः**

####  Part 1 - The knower of the Kṣetra (for the enjoyment of the Muktas) - i.e., the Vaikuṇṭha

Bhagavān is called "**क्षेत्रज्ञः**" because he knows the extremely suitable place for conferring on the Released Souls in this way the joy of enjoying Him. The suffix '**कः**'is added to the root '**ज्ञा**' (to know) in the word **क्षेत्रज्ञः** according to the grammatical rule which says - "The suffix '**कः**' is added to a root which ends in '**-आ**' (like **ज्ञा**), when it is not preceded by a preposition and the final '**आ**' of the root is dropped" [[16.1]](#f161). The Paramavyoma, i.e., Vaikuṇṭha, [[f25]](#ff25) is referred to here as Kṣetra (field), because it is the place which yields the crop of Bliss in plenty. Or 'Kṣetra' may mean the body of Bhagavān itself possessed of a similar quality. The Vedic Mantra proclaims — "Brahman has Ākāśa (i.e. Vaikuṇṭha) as its body".

In Nārāyaṇīya (Mokṣadharmaparva), the goal of attainment by the Mukta, i.e. Paramātmā, is specified as the 'Kṣetrajña' in the following Śloka -

"Oh Brahma! The goal of attainment for the Muktas is specified as the Kṣetrajña." [[16.2]](#f162)

#### Part 2 - Paramavyoma is the place where the Muktas enjoy Bhagavān's Bliss

That again is the place where the Muktas enjoy Bhagavān.

“He (the Mukta) enjoys (Bhagavān) in Paramavyoma (i.e., Vaikuṇṭha)." [[12.23]](#f1223)

“The greatness (in the form of enjoying Bhagavān)- is obtained by the Mukta in Vaikuṇṭha." [[12.19]](#f1219)

“He (the Mukta) shines in Vaikuṇṭha.” [[16.3]](#f163)

“He (the Mukta) enjoys Bliss in Vaikuṇṭha" [[16.4]](#f164)

Here is a Mantra which expresses the wish of a Mukta who does not want rebirth in this world -

“When compared with the eternal Vaikuṇṭha, this Ākāśa (Ether) adorned with flower-like stars is without lustre like night. I go to Vaikuṇṭha and begin to live there. May I not have rebirth." [[16.5]](#f165)

“That is the Supreme Abode of Mine, after reaching which they (the Released Souls) do not come back." [[16.6]](#f166)

In the Mokṣadharma, it is said - "When the soul gets rid of the fear of old age and death, he becomes endowed with the auspicious qualities mentioned in the authoritative texts viz. Vedas and Āgamas, and he becomes freed from the cause (i.e. Karma) and its fruit (i.e. the body).\
The Ākāśa he reaches (i.e., Vaikuṇṭha) is without the name and form of the ordinary world and he remains there without a body (like the one in the material world)" [[16.7]](#f167)

In the Viṣṇupurāṇa -

"Those yogins who are exclusively devoted to Brahman and who are engaged in Its meditation, reach a supreme place which the Sūris (Nityasūris) are always seeing (i.e. enjoying)." [[16.8]](#f168)

In the Brahmapurāṇa much is said about Vaikuṇṭha, it begins with these words -

"That is called 'Parama-Vyoma' about which it is said that there is nothing in it (like those that are seen in this world)." [[16.9]](#f169)

Then it continues

"The undisputed conclusion is that it is the place known as Mokṣa, and that it is the place of Supreme Effulgence (**परम् तेज**) which belongs to Viṣṇu" [[16.9]](#f169)

#### Part 3 - More on Vaikuṇṭham being the supreme abode

In the Varāhapurāṇa, Bhagavān says to sage Agastya —

"See this world which exists for My sake and which is not seen even by the Vedas. O best of Dvijas! This world has been shown to you in order to please you." [[16.10]](#f1610)

Agastya says in the Varāhapurāṇa —

"O Lord! the world that pertains to you is the best and the noblest of all worlds. O Sage, I have seen all the worlds of Brahma, Indra and others. Oh best of ascetics! It appears to me that this is a unique world. It is replete with wealth and riches and radiance as well as gem-set storeys of palaces. O Sage engaged in the practice of severe austerities! I am even now steeped in the meditation on that supreme world. When am I going to reach that best and noblest of all worlds? This is the thought that is ever haunting me" [[16.10]](#f1610) and so on.

In Ṛgvidhi (Jitantestotram) it is stated -

"They say that this Supreme Abode is the primary cause of all effects, the highest objective of all words, and the ultimate object of realisation of the Yogas." [[16.11]](#f1611)

#### Part 4 - More on Vaikuṇṭham being the supreme abode

Sage Dhaumya speaks Sn the Āraṇyaparva very highly about that place and says -

"The Supreme Lord, Nārāyaṇa, is the Deity, without beginning or end, and He is said to be the eternal cause of the Primordial matter from which all beings emerge. His supreme world is far more effulgent than the world of Brahma." [[16.12]](#f1612)

"O Bhārata (Yudhiṣṭhira!) The souls after reaching it do not return to this world. O King! This place is firm, imperishable and indestructible. O Yudhiṣṭhira! Bow always before this world which pertains to the Lord." [[16.13]](#f1613)

In the Harivaṃśa, in the episode in which the Vaidikaputras are carried away and are brought back by Bhagavān, who Himself says —

"The best of Bharatas! (Arjuna); You have seen that celestial world of wonder full of Brahmic effulgence. I am He (whom you saw there) and that is the effulgence of Mine which is eternal. That is my Supreme Prakṛti (or Transcendent Nature) which is both Vyakta and Avyakta (manifest to the devotee, and unmanifest to the impious). O Best of Bharatas! The Souls (Jīvas) enter this Prakṛti and they become Muktas (Released Souls), O Pārtha! it's the goal for the Sāṃkhyās (i.e., those who meditate upon the Jīvātmā for its realisation) and for the yogins addicted to Penance. The entire Universe which wishes to attain it resorts with devotion to that Supreme Brahman." [[16.14]](#f1614)

#### Part 5 - More on Vaikuṇṭham being the supreme abode

The reputed Brahmasaṃhitā narrates the serial order of the Tattvas and says -

"Paramapuruṣa resides in the heart-lotus and He is multifaced. He is omniscient, all pervading, and is Himself all things, He stands enveloping all things. The pure and subtle (**परम, सूक्ष्म**) Ākāśa (Vaikuṇṭha) shines with His effulgence. That Transcendent world (Paramapada) is like pure crystal and replete with joy. Those who have realised the Tattvas attain this world and are freed from the touch of things both auspicious and inauspicious (i.e, Puṇya and Pāpa). They are of the size of a Trasareṇu (i.e. a particle of dust composed of three atoms) and are adorned by millions of rays. Neither do they take birth in this world, nor do they die." [[16.15]](#f1615)

#### Part 6

All this is well-known from passages like these. In this Paramapada, there is a city which goes by the name of 'Ayodhyā' and 'Aparājitā’. There is a Palatial mansion 'Aparājitam' (Invincible) by name. There is a Hall of celestial beauty supported by thousand pillars etc. In it is a couch on which the Lord along with Lakshmi is to be meditated upon as the object of enjoyment for the numberless Released Souls. All this is well-known from the Chāndogya, Taittirīya, Kauṣītakī and other Upaniṣads.

### 17. अक्षरः / Akṣaraḥ - He who never wanes [[ot]](#ot17)

**ॐ अक्षराय नमः**

He is called Akṣara, because He never becomes less (due to infinite enjoyment frmo the multitude of Muktas); but as the object of enjoyment He ever grows more and more like a stream of honey in spite of His being enjoyed by the Muktas at all times there. Such is the manifestation of His unlimited qualities.

The suffix '**अच्**' is added to the verb 'Kṣarati' according to the grammatical rule that the suffix '**अच्**' should be added after 'pacati' [[17.1]](#f171), [[f26]](#ff26) and other verbs. The names 'Vikramaḥ' (79) and Śurānandaḥ' (188) are words ending with the suffix '**अच्**'

"Paramapuruṣa is unsullied even though He is attained and enjoyed (by others, i.e., Muktas). Since He does not owe His greatness to others and since He is great by Himself, His supreme nature never diminishes"

<div id="ff27r" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

In the Śārīraka (i.e., Brahmasūtras) in the fourth chapter, mokṣa has been affirmed to be of this kind. This chapter cannot be interpreted as delineating fruits of a lower order. In that case the earlier three chapters which deal with the means of attaining Salvation, the Upaniṣadic texts which have been quoted as authority, and Sṃṛti, Itihāsa and other Scriptures also will have to be taken as dealing with those fruits of a lower order, and all of them will become Śāstras that have nothing to do with the Mokṣa. Thus Bhagavān is the Supreme Goal of attainment for the Muktas. [[f27]](#ff27)

## Further notes

<div id="ff1" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

[[f1]](#tr10) पूत means "cleaned, purified, pure, clear, bright". From the root <a target="_blank" href="https://sanskritdictionary.com/?q=p%C5%AB%22&lang=sans&action=Search">पूञ्</a>. Check in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/scans/MWScan/2020/web/webtc/indexcaller.php">Monier Williams</a> 

<div id="ff2" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

[[f2]](#ff2r) In the Śvetāśvataropaniṣad verse quoted here, Bhagavān is referred to in the feminīne gender ("अजाम्"), while the other unborn (Jīvātmā) is referred to in the masculine form. This supplements the <a target="_blank" href="https://aurvadahana.github.io/posts/vishnu-sahasranama-bgd-1/#ff2">feminine references</a> of Bhagavān in Śruti, and also references to Bhagavān as the mother with Her womb as the Universe. Note that Śruti also switches the genders sometimes, calling all Jīvās as fundamentally feminine in their devotion to Bhagavān. (***पुरुषोत्तम स एव स्त्री प्रायम् इतरम् सर्वम्** - He alone is Puruṣottama, all else are strī-s by nature).

<div id="ff3" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

[[f3]](#ff3r) This comes under the Sarvagatatvādhikaraṇa of the Brahmasūtra, where the all-pervasiveness of Brahma is diuscussed. The previous sūtra (1.2.7) clears the question of whether *the Being which abides in the heart of all may not be Brahman, since the Being is restricted to a small amount of space (in the heart)*. There also exists Upaniṣadvākyas such as **अणोरणीयान्महतोमहीयान्** (Kaṭhopaniṣad. <a target="_blank" href="https://upanishads.org.in/upanishads/3/1/2/20">1.2.20</a>) which dispells this doubt. This sūtra (1.2.8) poses the question that *on account of Bhagavān residing in the heart of Jīvātmās, their experiences should be the same*. But this view is rejected due to the intrinsic difference between their nature (highlighed by the word **वैशेष्यात्** in the sūtra).

<div id="ff4" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

[[f4]](#ff4r) **पृषदुदरो यस्य = पृषोदरम्, पृषद् उद्वानं यस्य = पृषोद्वानम्**

<div id="ff5" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

[[f5]](#ff5r) The famous interpretation of this is along the lines of Advaita Siddhānta. Though it can be interpreted easily in a dualistic sense ("only He "existed" before creation, all Avarātmās waiting to be created"), there is a beautiful Śrīvaiṣṇava interpretation as well, which does not rely on the temporal context of "before" or "after" creation: When it is said "only Devadatta existed", it also indicates to the existence of his body. Similarly, when it is said only He exists, it also indicates to the existence to Him as the Paramātmā and His body, which by Śarīrātmabhāva also points to the existence of multiple Jīvas which are His body.

<div id="ff6" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

[[f6]](#ff6r) The interpretation of "none different from Him" is similar to the lines of the previous note.

<div id="ff7" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

[[f7]](#ff7r) The seventeen guṇas are - Pañcajñānendriyas, Pañcakarmendriyas, Pañcapraṇāḥ, Manas, Kāla. The 16 kalās are mentioned in the Praśnopaniṣad.

<div id="ff8" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

[[f8]](#ff8r) The eight qualities mentioned here which is inherent to Bhagavān (and to the Muktajīvas) are elaborated in the Chāndogyopaniṣad <a target="_blank" href="https://upanishads.org.in/upanishads/11/8/7/1">8.7.1</a>. They are: Apahatapāpmatva (free from all sins), Vijaratva (free from old age), Vimṛtyutva (free from death), Viśokatva (free from sorrow), Vijighatsatva (free from hunger), Apipāsatva (free from thirst or desire), Satyakāmatva (infallible desire, or desire for Satya), and Satyasaṅkalpatva (infallible Will).

<div id="ff9" style="position: absolute; left: -9999px;">Placeholder</div>

[[f9]](#ff9r) This Adhikaraṇa, according to Rāmānuja, addresses the point of apparent contradiction of existence of multiple qualities (such as Apahatapāpmatva, Satyasaṅkalpatva etc) inherent to Jivātmā when it is said to be "**विज्ञानमात्रस्वरूप**". Just like a lump of salt has its taste inherent to it, but also has other inherent qualities such as colour, texture, and so on.

[[f10]](#ff10r) The end of this verse in Taittirīyopaniṣad has the distinctive singing of the Sāmagāna (**हा ३ वु हा ३ वु हा ३ वु**), highlighting the extent of the bliss of the Jivātmā.

[[f11]](#ff11r) This Adhikaraṇa, according to Rāmānuja, addresses the point of whether the Muktajīva for enjoyment has a body or not. Both Bādari's and Jaimini's view are accepted by Bādarāyaṇa when he compares the Muktajīva with the analogy of the Dvādaśāha sacrifice, which is performed in two different ways. In the contect of desire: either for progeny ("prajākāma": **द्वादशाहेन प्रजाकामं याजयेत्**), or for prosperity ("Ṛddhikāma": **द्वादशाहमृद्धिकामा उपेयुः**. Refer to the <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/ShriBhasyamOfRamanujaSanskritText/Shri%20Bhasyam%20of%20Ramanuja%20Sanskrit%20Text/page/n185/mode/2up?view=theater">Śrībhāṣya</a>; <a target="_blank" href="https://sacred-texts.com/hin/sbe48/sbe48563.htm">English translation</a>). Or in the context of yajamānas: as the Ahīna or Sattra type of yajña. The former has one dīkṣita yajamāna assisted by several priests, while the latter has multiple dīkṣita yajamānas (Ref: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24646756?read-now=1&seq=3#page_scan_tab_contents">Heesterman</a>, *Vrātya and Sacrifice, pp3*, where he quotes the Baudhāyana and Āpastamba Śrautasūtras as source. This is apparently opposed(?) by Jaimini in Pūrvamīmāṃsā <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/dli.ernet.170062/page/779/mode/2up?view=theater">10.6.60</a> where he says the Ahīna contains innumerable dīkṣita yajamānas). The Ahīna and Sattra are also divided according to the number of days in the yajña when the soma is pressed and extracted (**Abhiṣavaṇa**). The Ekāha type has only one such day, the Ahīna can have two to twelve days (as per Kātyāyana Śrautasūtra in his <a target="_blank" href="https://archive.org/details/LanJ_katyayan-shrauta-sutra-of-katyayan-with-explanation-by-vidyadhar-sharma-1932-pag/page/n785/mode/2up?view=theater">adhyāya</a> for **अहीननिरूपणम्**), and the Sattra has ≥ 12 days (as per the next **सत्त्रनिरूपणम्** adhyāya). It is noted here that the Dvādaśāha comes under either the Ahīna or Sattra type of yajña.

[[f12]](#ff12r) The intention of the quotations used by Parāśara Bhaṭṭar in this section is to imply the existence of multiplicity of Muktas as per the scriptures. Words like "**सर्वे**", "**आगताः**", "**उपयान्ति**" etc. conveys that.

[[f15]](#part-7---upādhis-for-muktas) Aupādhika Bhedābheda philosophy is meant. Bhāskara's siddhānta is an example of the same. It posits that, the absolute Brahman "becomes finite" when it is subjected to limiting adjuncts (upādhi-s); similar to how a diamond appears blue when a blue lotus is placed behind it, so too the Brahman "becomes finite" when subjected to upādhis. The "Jīvātmā" in this case really is finite and prone to suffering and bondage provided it is viewed from this limiting adjunct of ignorance. According to Bhāskara, this "bheda" is merely a temporary state, and as its natural state (and/or in jñānaprāpti), it really is a state of abheda. Mokṣa is removal of these upādhis.

[[f16]](#ff16r) Viṣṇucitta Āḻvān (also known by Eṅkaḷāḻvān / எங்களாழ்வான்) was a Śiṣya of Rāmānuja (எம்பெருமானார்) and also had Tirukkurukaippirān Piḷḷai (திருக்குருகைப்பிரான் பிள்ளை) as Ācāryan. (More about him <a target="_blank" href="https://guruparamparai.wordpress.com/2013/04/04/engalazhwan/">here</a>). For this verse, for "“**तद्भावभावम्**" he writes: **तस्य परस्य ब्रह्मणो भावाः अपहतपाप्मत्मादयोः धर्माः, तेषां भावम् - आविर्भावम् ।** i.e., the first "**भाव**" means the Guṇas of Parabrahma, such as Apahatapāpmatvādi guṇas mentioned in [[f8]](#ff8). These guṇas (**तेषां भावम्**) are manifested (**आविर्भावम्**), which Parāśara Bhaṭṭar clarifies is similarity of guṇas (**गुणैः सादृश्यम्**). Note: This "similarity" of guṇas is also what Madhvācārya <a target="_blank" href="https://aurvadahana.github.io/posts/harmonising-aikyasrutis-with-bhedasrutis/">mentions</a> to interpret Aikyavākyas in Śrutis.

[[f19]](#tr13) Notice again how Bhaṭṭar's Vyākhyāna maintains the thread of continuity along the names occurring in the stotra. Through this continuity, this commentary extends the interpretation to levels beyond what is etymologically derived from the word, while Śrī Śaṅkara (for example) seems to more strictly adhere to the literal meaning of the word in his bhāṣya (of course, there are also the inevitable differences in interpretation because of differences in siddhāntas). Here, the names 13 through 17 intend to continue the explanation of why and how He is "Muktānāṃ Paramāgatiḥ", the greatest and supreme gati for the Muktas - [(13)](#tr13) He does not send them back (to the cycle of Saṃsāra) once they reach Him; [(14)](#tr14) He generously gives (the enjoyment of His Bliss to the muktas in abundance); [(15)](#tr15) He witnesses the Muktas' enjoyment of Him and is in turn pleased, which again pleases the Muktas; [(16)](#tr16) He knows the right place for the muktas to get their eternal Bliss; and [(17)](#tr17) He is one whose Greatness never diminishes over time in spite of the constant Bliss that He provides to the muktas.

[[f22]](#ff22r) The repetition of the words of the Sūtra indicates the conclusion of this body of doctrine. Thus everything is settled to satisfaction. ("**सूत्राभ्यासश्शास्त्रपरिसमाप्ति द्योतयति**", writes Rāmānuja).

Even though it is the "right" interpretation and highlights Bhagavān's supremacy as oer Śāstra, the Bhagavadguṇadarpaṇa has much flavour and continuity to it in how it interprets the names according to context.
