  “And in a burst of light that blinded every angel<br>  
  As if the sky had blown the heavens into stars<br>
  You felt the gravity of tempered grace falling into empty space<br>
  No one there to catch you in their arms“

To-day, it was the day of colours, in an otherwise colourless world - within and without, with and without me. Not to say I am full of colour myself, but perhaps I take an illusionary solace in the knowledge and realisation of that fact. Infact, the closer one may get to me, the more colourful I get; but as the Nile with its long majesticity and shallow depth, so am I colourless once you dip in my waters.

I was reading about Betelgeuse the other day, simply because it was visible on the shoulder of Orion - the eternal and loyal companion, present even when ignored, even when nobody witnesses it. A red giant so vast, it can cover up entire orbits of the rocky planets of the solar system if placed concentric to the Sun; and so much younger than the Sun, yet so ancient it is a Myth of the legends. I read how it is destined to erupt in an explosion so grand, the entire explosion can last three glorious months, witnessed by no one - just a few apathetic inanimate by-standers. So glorious it outshines entire galaxies in that period. But ofcourse, the root of all Life and Glory is Evil, and so it collapses down into a small remnant of unfathomable gravity; smaller than cities, yet more powerful than entire solar systems. A rotten core which disintegrates anything which approaches it - including the all saving Light.

Where is the beauty in that Death, you say. Because it is selfish, it has no purpose other than itself; an eternal struggle with the ridiculously indifferent vast void. Because it would rather die with the semblance and illusion of meaning, than fade away into nothingess. Even the inanimate have the courage for this, and not much of us even have the knowledge of this; but perhaps *because* they're inanimate..

No one will witness this Glory, no one will applaud, no one will weep, no one will remain silent. Even for the gods, this is child's play, in their infinite Divinity and Apathy; sure, they know - but it is just a fraction of a millisecond of the flutter of their eyelashes. But this is the very moment of Glory for the Star. It may have the illusion of Victory because it does not think of anybody in its Death, not its past, not the gods, not for any witnesses - but solely about that moment to fulfill that purpose. It knows how purposeless it is, but it generates an entire spectrum of colour in this process.

I sit here, small but larger than the star, yet envying it - an inanimate titan that possess more courage and meaning in its end than I could scrape together in a million of my lifetimes. It is ironic, because Betelgeuse does not wrestle with doubt, or box ("fashionable") with the universe for validation. It simply exists, alone and glorious, walking with purpose towards the glorious Death written in its core, right from the moment it was born. It will paint the sky with Fire, a long moment for us lesser beings, but a speck of a second in its lifetime. It is Holy, it is worthy of Worship. It does not care about the inevitable aftermath, it is a Death which expects nothing, demands nothing; only its denser power of an otherwise harmless size, showing the remnants of its glory. I call it Evil not out of any Malice it may possess; for kindness and malice are born out of lesser beings who "think", but out of awe of its indifference, its immense power which sets its Isolation in stone (or literally, Neutron Star), bending anything to its Nature, forever unchanging, living on for millions and billions of years till it fades away to nothingness. Decay is Evil, which Betelgeuse cannot stand. Perhaps I am the core with no beautiful husk to speak of.

I am merely a witness to this star, one among millions, being carried by Orion in the eternal dance of the skies. I "think" (even at that, it is pretentious). I envy the clarity of betelgeuse in its unapolegetic arc. I wish I could burn like that - briefly, fiercely, for nobody but myself, with nobody to witness, in total isolation, yet with a holy purpose - gaining immortality in it, yet decaying away. Not to search for meaning, but simply is. Maybe it is a circle; to forget about this knowledge and to be ignorant - then I would not aspire to be like the Star, and be but a rock in the Asteroid Belt, floating in its blissfully ignorant Apathy. I feel more helpless than an inanimate lump of cosmic dust drifting in space, and a profound sadness that I will not witness the glory of betelgeuse. Free, yet not free to even move my limbs. I have no script for Meaning, except to collide with a wall and break into a handful of pieces
