There has been plenty confusion on whether Buddha is an avatāra of Bhagavān or not, and if He is, whether the Siddhārtha Gautama that we know of, as the founder of the Buddhist sect, is the same avatāra. Let us look at few of the evidences of Buddhāvatāra from Purāṇas, and what the purpose of this incarnation was.

## The purpose of this avatāra

As the Viṣṇu Purāṇa explains clearly, the Daityas defeated the Devas and took up the practice of vaidika dharma. All the offerings which are to be given to the devas were taken up by them. And due to their observance of dharma, they were in-turn protected by dharma, as a dharmakavaca (as we know, dharmo rakṣati rakṣitaḥ).

The devas then did tapasyā of Bhagavān and asked him to help them. Hence Bhagavān took up the form of Māyāmoha and preached the bauddhārhata-ādi false doctrines to the daityas to lead them away from vaidikadharma.

As He told them that this mahādharmam is worthy (<a target="_blank" href="https://www.learnsanskrit.cc/translate?search=arhata&dir=se">arhata</a>) to be preached to them, the teachings were called Ārhata.

> **अर्हतैतं महाधर्मं मायामोहेन ते यतः \|**
>
> **प्रोक्तास्तमाश्रिता धर्ममार्हतास्तेन तेऽभवत् \|\| (Viṣṇupurāṇa 3.18.13)**
>
> ..The Daityas were seduced from their proper duties by the repeated lessons of their illusory preceptor (Māyāmoha), maintaining the equal truth of contradictory tenets; and they were called Arhatas, from the phrase he had employed of “Ye are worthy (Arhatha) of this great doctrine;” that is, of the false doctrines which he persuaded them to embrace.

He preaches śūnyavāda to the daityas, and repeatedly asks them to know (budhyata) and understand (budhyadhvam) it. Hence he establishes the avaidika bauddha darśana

> **एवं बुध्यत बुध्यध्वं बुध्यतैवमितीरयन् \|**
>
> **मायामोहः स दैतेयान्धर्ममत्याजयन्निजम् \|\| (VP 3.18.20)**
>
> In this manner, exclaiming to them, “Know!” (Budhyadvam), and they replying, “It is known” (Budhyate), these Daityas were induced by the arch deceiver to deviate from their religious duties (and become Bauddhas), by his repeated arguments and variously urged persuasions

As the Viṣṇusahasranāma says (and Parāśara Bhaṭṭar elaborates)

> **शुभाङ्गो लोकसाराङ्गः सुतन्तुः तन्तुवर्धनः (84)**

- He is **Śubhāṅga** - One with a bewitching form to delude the daityas, with a fascinating and charming body which made them think that he was an extremely trustworthy man

- He is **Lokasārāṅga** - Who preached the 2 essential things in the world, which are enjoyment of worldly pleasures and mokṣa

- He is **Sutantu** - Who had a powerful net of threads, to capture the daityas in them by putting on an appearance of tranquillity

- He is **Tantuvardhana** - He who increases the meshes, using them to trap the daityas forever in the snare of saṃsāra. As Bhagavān says in the Gītā, those of demoniac disposition are repeatedly thrown in the cycle of saṃsāra by him (**तानहं द्विषतः क्रूरान् संसारेषु नराधमान्** - Bhhagavadgītā 16.19)

Due to the following delusive teachings of Bhagavān, the daityas started giving up the vaidika dharma. They started doing veda/devanindā, treated yajñas with scorn, and spoke disgusting things about brāhmaṇas.

> **केचद्विनिन्दां वेदानां देवानामपरे द्विज ।**
>
> **यज्ञकर्मकलापस्य तथान्ये च द्विजन्मनाम् ।।**
>
> **नैतद्युक्तिसहं वाक्यं हिंसा धर्माय नेष्यते ।**
>
> **हवींष्यनलदग्धानि फलायेत्यर्भकोदितम ।।**
>
> **यज्ञैरनेकैर्देवत्वमवाप्येन्द्रण भुज्यते ।**
>
> **शम्यादि यदि चेत्काष्ठं तदूरं पत्रभुक् पशुः ।।**
>
> **निहतस्य पशोर्यज्ञ स्वर्गप्रात्पिर्यदीष्यते ।**
>
> **स्वपिता यजमानेन किन्नु तस्मान्न हन्यते ।।**
>
> **तृत्पये जायते पुंसो भुक्तमन्येन चेत्ततः ।**
>
> **कुर्याच्छ्राद्ध श्रद्धयान्नं न वहेयुः प्रवासिनः ।।**
>
> Some then spake evil of the sacred books; some blasphemed the gods; some treated sacrifices and other devotional ceremonies with scorn; and others calumniated the Brahmans. “The precepts,” they cried, “that lead to the injury of animal life (as in sacrifices) are highly reprehensible. To say that casting butter into flame is productive of reward, is mere childishness. If Indra, after having obtained godhead by multiplied rites, is fed upon the wood used as fuel in holy fire, he is lower than a brute, which feeds at least upon leaves. If an animal slaughtered in religious worship is thereby raised to heaven, would it not be expedient for a man who institutes a sacrifice to kill his own father for a victim? If that which is eaten by one at a Śrāddha gives satisfaction to another, it must be unnecessary for one who resides at a distance to bring food for presentation in person

Due to their tyāga of vedas, they lost the "dharmakavaca" which had shielded them, and hence weakened, were easily subdued by the devas.

Śrī Madhva clarifies in his Mahābhārata Tātparyanirṇaya that the teachings of Buddha, although it may seem avaidika, actually has guptārtha which is very much vaidika. After deluding the asuras, this original meaning he teaches to the devas for their own benefit before he passes on to his own abode. Śrī Madhva calls these teachings as "praśāntavidyā".

## The birth circumstances of Buddha

Śrīmadbhāgavatam 1.3.24 says Buddha was born to his mother Añjanā in Kīkaṭa deśa

Garuḍapurāṇa 1.1.32 says the same, and that he was born as son of Jina - **बुद्धो नाम्रा जिनसुतः कीकटेषु भविष्यति**

Agnipurāṇa 16.1-6 speaks of the Buddhāvatāra, who preached the Bauddhārhata darśanas and was born as a son of Śuddhodana - **मायामोहस्वरूपोसौ शुद्धोदनसुतोऽभवत्**

Considering these evidences, Śrī Madhva has posit in his Mahābhārata Tātparyanirṇaya that the Tripurāsuras were born as Śuddhodana and Jina, and as the former's son "Siddhārtha Gautama" was born at Gayākṣetra. Seeing this, ŚrīHari immediately throws the baby away and takes his position.

Observing that the daityas practice vaidikadharma, He laughs and to display the element of divinity (to bewitch them into believing his teachings) he establishes his supremacy by battling all the devatās including Rudra. He then converts his cakra into a seat and daityas immediately accept the teachings taught by him. Hence by practice of avaidika dharmas, all of them went to andhaḥtamas.

Thus, the Gautama Buddha that is known to us is, infact, not Bhagavān's avatāra as per the Mādhva (and even Rāmānuja) doctrine, but the Bauddha darśana that we see today is very much his own. But as the verse from Viṣṇupurāṇa above mentions, much of it would be corrupted now due to the additions (including veda/deva/brāhmaṇa nindās) of the bauddhas.

## Praśāntavidyā

## Some additional comments

1. One interesting thing to note is that the Māyāmoha form of Bhagavān in the Viṣṇupurāṇa, appears as a naked mendicant with shaven head and a peacock's feather.

2. Someone had claimed to me that Śrī Vallabhācārya had not considered Buddha as an avatāra, but this is false, as he himself had written otherwise in his Śri Subodhinī (commentary on the Bhāgavata Purāṇa)
